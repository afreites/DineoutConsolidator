ChIJ19HF1vpSV0ARhuyTtUxBggk,5,A great selection of beers! And the food is good too. Everything is well priced and the staff is super friendly! Ask for Chris he's great!
ChIJ19HF1vpSV0ARhuyTtUxBggk,5,"great beer on tap - some very very cool  European beers that you do not see many places. The food was good, and well priced. The patio is wonderful, all around a great place to grab a pint of three."
ChIJ19HF1vpSV0ARhuyTtUxBggk,4,"Very good selection of beers! We didn't eat there but the sausage looks so good!
I only put 4 because the service wasn't very good.. Super slow, wasn't taking care of us and there were almost nobody"
ChIJ19HF1vpSV0ARhuyTtUxBggk,5,"The food and the beer here is superb! All the schnitzels are huge portions! I love it! Staff is nice! The pretzel dip is also a large dish, great for sharing!"
ChIJ19HF1vpSV0ARhuyTtUxBggk,5,"When we visited Toronto luckly we found this place. A lot of beer choices in there I mean a lot so many very much choices from Germany, Austria, Belgium, Holland, Canada, France...etc friendly staff can help you to choose. You can sit outside or inside that a little bit noisy. The ambiance was classy and cozy. I definitely recommend this place."
ChIJ-e2VttE0K4gR9qSbe6Tct04,5,Superior food at an affordable price. Fast and friendly service. Neighborhood ambiance. What more can you desire?
ChIJ-e2VttE0K4gR9qSbe6Tct04,5,"This was by far one of the best culinary experiences of my life! The food was so beautiful, so fresh, and so delicious that it brought tears to my eyes! The friendly service was also beyond this world! I‚Äôve never had such an amazing experience at a restaurant in Toronto! It was so good that they deserve a few Michelin stars...
Jason, Eugene, and Bruce, thank you for such an incredible experience! I‚Äôll be back and I‚Äôll bring all of my friends too!"
ChIJ-e2VttE0K4gR9qSbe6Tct04,5,We had fresh and delicious omakase sushi here as well as some excellent and beautifully prepared  sashimi. Traditional style. Exactly what we were looking for. Will come again next time in Toronto!
ChIJ-e2VttE0K4gR9qSbe6Tct04,5,A truly unique and intimate setting at Yuzu. The sushi and sashimi were elegantly plated with artistic touches. The fish tasted fresh and vibrant. I would recommend sitting at the counter to watch the masters working. Can‚Äôt wait to come back for the Omakase.
ChIJ-e2VttE0K4gR9qSbe6Tct04,5,Best Sushi in the downtown core. Quality and variety are the best available.
ChIJ0zE_DsE0K4gR8rEk8B9DNg4,4,"No A/C so it's very humid, cash only. Great dumplings at reasonable prices. Predominantly boiled and steamed, only three fried dumpling options, so if you prefer fried ones you're better off going to Dumpling House down the road. Cute little library to borrow from at the front. The smoothie was nearly $5 for a pretty standard powdered mango milk smoothie, a little disappointing for the price, but the food and service was great."
ChIJ0zE_DsE0K4gR8rEk8B9DNg4,5,"My wife and I ate lunch at Mother Dumplings. I saw the ratings online and it lived up to everything we read. The beef with broccoli was amazing, the beef and chives dumplings were so delicious, and our pork soup with noodles were to die for. When you sit down, they provide you with tea. The wait staff was great. We live in the states, but will definitely go back every time we come back to Toronto."
ChIJ0zE_DsE0K4gR8rEk8B9DNg4,5,"Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Best Chinese food I've ever had! Seriously. It absolutely lived up to its hype. The dumplings were out of this world. My beef and broccoli were so, so tasty. I also had a crispy pancake. Yum. I want to keep going back."
ChIJ0zE_DsE0K4gR8rEk8B9DNg4,5,"Great little hole in the wall. They take cash only, so come prepared. 3 types of dumplings and a potato pancake was around $20. Perfect as a little snack to share with two people. 

I didn't get much of a chance to check over the menu, but I could see from the other patrons, that the food was plentiful and probably cheap.

Definitively will be checking this place out again."
ChIJ0zE_DsE0K4gR8rEk8B9DNg4,5,"My favorite restaurant in Toronto so far. Really good dumplings at a good price. Decent service, not great, but better than most of the restaurants I went to in Toronto.  Would definitely recommend and would go back if I had more time"
ChIJr9ikgg0tK4gR5gOLzpbB7Po,5,Really good food! The salmon was flavourful and the cream sauce was delicious. The wasabi raw octopus was really tasty. It came with some seaweed as well. The salmon dish came with a side of radishes. There was only one waitress serving so I felt a bit bad.
ChIJr9ikgg0tK4gR5gOLzpbB7Po,4,"Food - portion size is very small. The food is tapas style. Everything has such a punch of unique flavours. The potato cream curry udon is so unique! Must try. Their sashimi is amazing. The dishes are plated to beautifully!
Service - the food comes out SUPER quick! Waitresses are really nice too. 
Price - $83 for 6 dishes 
You really need to pay $30-40 per person to be full. 
The only thing holding me back from rating 5/5 stars is the price. Hard to justify."
ChIJr9ikgg0tK4gR5gOLzpbB7Po,4,Great food but the portions are a bit too small. I ordered the seafood yaki udon and they forgot to put mussels in my plate. Atmosphere and decor is quite nice and aesthetic.
ChIJr9ikgg0tK4gR5gOLzpbB7Po,5,"Love this place! Mostly udon but they do it in different styles, Japanese, Korean, Western. I‚Äôve been getting the Salmon cream sauce, it‚Äôs really good and comes with a piece of cooked salmon. But usually gets a little rich towards the end. The Koroke is really good too! Service is also quite good, really like the vibe there, great spot for dates!"
ChIJr9ikgg0tK4gR5gOLzpbB7Po,4,"Great place for drinks and miscellaneous noodle dishes.  
Good service."
ChIJtSVPFTQyK4gR2m1Ga46fGvU,4,"It's nice, with industrialized decor outside Yorkdale. Had the pasta and burger. It's 'good' but after considering costs it becomes more 'okay'.

The Crispy Polenta Side was by far the star of our meal. When the side is better than the main dishes, it speaks to how the mains need to innovate a bit more as it felt not much different than pickle barrel."
ChIJtSVPFTQyK4gR2m1Ga46fGvU,4,Went here for my birthday. The pasta was average. Not bad but could be better. The ambiance is nice especially after a tiring round of shopping in Yorkdale Shopping Centre since it's within the mall. Their drink menu is better than their food which is nice. Our server was very polite and attentive as well. I would go back!
ChIJtSVPFTQyK4gR2m1Ga46fGvU,5,"This is a fantastic spot to have a meal if you are at Yorkdale. Spacious and you can make reservations. It is accessible with a handicap bathroom on the first floor which is great. Also they do a great job for food sensitivities, I've brought friends here who cannot have gluten or nuts. It's always been easy to accommodate groups here. I like the salads but the pizza and pasta are popular. This place is great if you are at the mall."
ChIJtSVPFTQyK4gR2m1Ga46fGvU,5,"I have been here several times and each time never been disappointed with the quality of food and service. 

All the staff I have encountered have been patient, kind and charismatic. And not the awkward kind of charisma! They are always informative whenever I or friends/family that I take with me have questions.

I can tell the food is cooked to a high standard and the setting of each plate really adds to the initial wow feeling you get when you receive your food.

I would definitely recommend this place whether you are looking for a longer sit down experience or even just a quick drop in and out."
ChIJtSVPFTQyK4gR2m1Ga46fGvU,5,The food is epic. We loved everything we ate. Great service and nice atmosphere. Server had British accent which was lovely. Wow mind blowing food and desserts.
ChIJ8Su7-ME0K4gRK_OfqwTtE-4,5,"I tried their Al Pastor tacos and they were very delicious, nice contrast of flavour. The hot and mild sauces complimented the tacos very well. The lady there was very friendly and welcoming, as well as the waitress and cook. I would definitely come back, I like the family atmosphere in the restaurant. I also like the Buddha statue they have on top of the fridge."
ChIJ8Su7-ME0K4gRK_OfqwTtE-4,2,"I'm curious to know how low the other reviewers' standards are to solicit 4 and 5 star rating for this place. The guacamole was synthetic and this weird neon green, the tacos were bland and sad, and I could smell the washroom that's in the basement from the main floor dining area. My partner's whose favourite is Mexican, said this is the worst Mexican place he's ever been to."
ChIJ8Su7-ME0K4gRK_OfqwTtE-4,5,The tacos are pretty good. I heard my Mexican boyfriend say its authentic. They have the best guacamole in my life.
ChIJ8Su7-ME0K4gRK_OfqwTtE-4,4,"The food is delicious. Tacos taste very good. You get 5 tacos per dish that aren't big in size. Price is the avg price for a meal in Toronto. However, 5 tacos aren't enough and you need at least a few more. Friendly staff and clean place. Serves some tasty drinks as well."
ChIJ8Su7-ME0K4gRK_OfqwTtE-4,4,This is a really authentic mexican place. The food is amazing and the service is good. One thing i always notice at a place when i go in groups is how hassle free individual payments is. The payment software here seemed really intuitive and fast. We paid with ease without having to spend too much time pointing out what we ate. I will definitely go back here
ChIJryijc9s0K4gRG9aU7SDTXdA,5,"Phenomenal. The food was fantastic. I could only get a seat in the bar section, so the menu is slightly different.  We ordered everything off the many for a group of four and it was all phenomenal. A good selection of dishes and deserts.  Reasonably priced too, for being the best restaurant around."
ChIJryijc9s0K4gRG9aU7SDTXdA,5,"Fantastic restaurant when you're looking for a nicer meal and are OK with spending a few extra dollars. The staff is attentive, the wine list is great and they gave daily specials. I loved the way they prepared my beef and veggies. 

I definitely recommend making reservations and heading over earlier to make sure you can get in."
ChIJryijc9s0K4gRG9aU7SDTXdA,4,"Alo does an excellent job of bringing art to the plate. They are very detailed in how they construct the plates as well as the elements that went into the dish. I must say all flavors worked very well and each plate felt like a seamless transition. The staff are extremely professional and provide the high class environment you pay for. You'll spend about 200 a person after tax and tip for a ten course meal. It took my table just under 3 hours. Bathrooms are beautiful, decor is modern. I thoroughly enjoyed and wish I had more of 6/10 dishes. At this price point, I expect all plates to awe... then you'll get my full 5 stars."
ChIJryijc9s0K4gRG9aU7SDTXdA,5,Best restaurant in Toronto. Dining here. Service and food was extraordinary. Staff didn't miss a beat and were very polite. Great atmosphere and would highly recommend
ChIJryijc9s0K4gRG9aU7SDTXdA,5,"A spectacular melange of gastronomical delights. Service par excellence. A hidden gem in plain sight. Wonderful juxtaposition of place and space. Fantastic bar. And the bread! The bread. So pillowy and warm. What an experience. If you can book it, do it. The service was impeccable. Very friendly and unpretentious. The food was incredible. Better than any of the Michelin star restaurants I've been to. The wines were exotic and delicious. Can't say a single negative thing about this place."
ChIJ6Z2CjtE0K4gRNUgpAr1SDbk,5,"The service was amazing, as was their whiskey selection. Food quality was superb. My wife and I enjoyed an amazing meal here. They split dishes up so that we could have our own tastings. The selection was extensive. Being able to select local beef as well as USDA prime or Japanese Kobe was a treat."
ChIJ6Z2CjtE0K4gRNUgpAr1SDbk,5,"I don't know where to begin... the service was incredible, the food was excellent, and the whiskey/wine selection was unlike anything I have seen in the U.S. I had the A5 Hokkaido tenderloin, and my wife had the mushroom pasta- both were delicious. The fried feta appetizer was our favorite thing we ate while in Toronto... it was incredible. I would highly recommend getting a reservation here if you're looking for a nice dinner."
ChIJ6Z2CjtE0K4gRNUgpAr1SDbk,5,I went to Michael's for my girlfriends birthday dinner and it definitely lived up to the hype. It was outstanding in every sense of a dining experience. I had the Kobe steak which was presented to me with a special knife of my choice. It was a really awesome experience. I would definitely recommend trying it out at least once.
ChIJ6Z2CjtE0K4gRNUgpAr1SDbk,4,Want to impress your date or coworkers?  Take them here.  Want to go broke on delicious food? Go here.  Want to grab a steak and a beer then this isn't your place.  It's a really fancy place to eat but I just couldn't justify eating here unless it was a VERY special occasion
ChIJ6Z2CjtE0K4gRNUgpAr1SDbk,5,"I haven‚Äôt had a dining experience quite like this before. They were incredibly attentive to all of our needs, always asking how things were and if we were enjoying our meals. They wanted to give us the best possible service. I‚Äôd highly recommend giving them a try."
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRJlAfFrJF15s,4,"Cozy and inexpensive Italian restaurant with hearty pasta, filling sandwiches, large healthy salads and small but okay selection of wines. The restaurant is good enough for a date or dinner with friends, but instead of fancy King West vibe, the ambience here is more of a family Italian trattoria with homemade food. I often grab their pasta or salad for lunch to go, and it feeds me all day long."
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRJlAfFrJF15s,5,"I made a reservation for a large group of 13 on a Tuesday evening, the staff were very kind and accommodating to us all, being such a large group in a modestly sized restaurant downtown core of Toronto I am very appreciative of their efforts. The food was just as amazing as the staff, try the pizza or the pasta or both! that's what we all did and it was very worth while.  I really hope to go again soon to try their other dishes!"
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRJlAfFrJF15s,5,"Ate here after the Raptor's parade. Been coming off and on for years, but it's been a while since I last ate at this establishment.

The service was great - my 2 year old daughter wolfed down the food, it was so good!

Highly recommend."
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRJlAfFrJF15s,5,Eaten at Fusaro's three or four times now and will definitely go again! Their pasta is to die for. I'm vegetarian and love getting the primavera. Wish I knew the secret to their sauce! The service is very friendly too.
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRJlAfFrJF15s,5,"One of the best Italian restaurants around. I probably had their Fiorentina more than 10 times. A great vibe, good service and great people. Highly recommend this place for their food!"
ChIJt-SE0aQ1K4gRvgMte-DhLnk,5,It was so yummy and filling. Only street parking and they accept master card. The ventilation system keeps you from smelling like dinner all evening. Fairly small restaurant so you may need to share a large table.
ChIJt-SE0aQ1K4gRvgMte-DhLnk,4,"All you can eat Korean BBQ!!! What more can I say?
Great service. If your grill is getting chard, don't worry they will replace it before you even need to ask.
Quick service. After you fill out the paper, the food platters arrive within 2 minutes.
Food quality. Seems to be fresh enough to be served to my friend who has stomach problems.
Food flavour. Those beef ribs!!! Oh gosh so default but so good!
Will return!"
ChIJt-SE0aQ1K4gRvgMte-DhLnk,3,"ARTERIES in beef slices. There's nothing worse than eating delicious food and taking a bite and getting hard chewy tubes in your mouth to which you pull out and to utter disgust lose your appetite... But besides that the food is amazing, the staff are fast and friendly, and they also filled our waters often! (I drink a lot of water). 
If you don't mind risking your appetite being ruined by finding harmless arteries in your meat then go! Yummm"
ChIJt-SE0aQ1K4gRvgMte-DhLnk,5,Excellent food. Excellent service. Overall it is a cheap and pleasant experience. Be aware the Chum Churum is actually a hard liquor and it's potent to say the least.....
ChIJt-SE0aQ1K4gRvgMte-DhLnk,5,I've been going to the location for a number of years and always have a good self-grill experience. The beef raw meats are nice marinated and are my favourite with the salmon. Tables and grills are clean and the staff is fast and friendly.
ChIJS1HeGM7T1IkR49_PD388HCY,5,"I love this place. Food is always great and staff is friendly. They are closed Sundays. There is very limited seating inside. Warning, they do sometimes run out of a particular dish by dinner time as things do get sold out so get there earlier in the day, or place your order ahead of time. There is always a line up here but it is worth it!"
ChIJS1HeGM7T1IkR49_PD388HCY,5,"The taste and the quality of preparation. I had Red Snapper fish meal, delicious! The price is a little bit high compared to other restaurant. If you want taste, this is the place. The place was full and this restaurant is very popular in the area. They loved the food selection. High fives!"
ChIJS1HeGM7T1IkR49_PD388HCY,4,"Popular Caribbean takeout in the area. And the food is out of this world. What can I say? This place is simply amazing food. They are always busy at lunch time. But it's always done right and delicious. Good prices. Daily specials. With a wide variety of food choices, you can't go wrong with this authentic Caribbean food."
ChIJS1HeGM7T1IkR49_PD388HCY,5,"I am a big fan of the place even though I just found out about it recently. For once in very few times I found great food from a great place with great courteous service. No more screw face, eye rolls, kiss teeth, and attitudes in order to get good food to eat. Big props to Chris and his staff, keep up the great work and even better food! See you next week! 
P.s. Everything I have eaten her is second to none. Oxtail, jerk chicken, fried chicken was ridiculous!!ü•áüî•"
ChIJS1HeGM7T1IkR49_PD388HCY,5,"everyone there is always real nice! love their hot sauce. the jerk chicken poutine is my favorite item here. they give more than enough meat, cheese and gravy. very filling...its become a weekly go to place for lunch."
ChIJhYdh1s80K4gRQNrXOimhfPE,5,Fantastic meat pie. No kangaroo pies though so that's weird. Take home pies in 4 packs is a great idea. Highly recommend.
ChIJhYdh1s80K4gRQNrXOimhfPE,4,The pepper steak was delicious but the Aussie traditional is over thought; it needs nothing more that meat and gravy.
ChIJhYdh1s80K4gRQNrXOimhfPE,1,"Kind of hit and miss.  A lot of times you go in, even during peak times like lunch hours or dinner hours, and they just don't have any selection.  Went in at 1:00 pm to find out no sausage rolls.  When I complained, I was branded ""rude"" and ""yelling"" at the employee, who refused to give me my money back and then told me she is refusing to serve me because  of it.  I didn't yell at her; I asked for my money back and when she told me that I would have to wait for manager, I told her that was ridiculous and that she should call someone to determine how to refund my money.  I realize this girl is only in there one day a week (Thursday), but perhaps it is one day too many!  She continued to berate me while I was there, so I finally just gave her the finger and left the store.  She ran out of the store yelling at me as I'm walking down the street.  Management really needs to be more discerning when hiring people.  I'm a very regular customer, and I suspect that I (used to) spend more money in a week in that place (purchasing $24.00 boxes of 4 pies for office staff, etc.) than they even pay her.  Bad form all around!"
ChIJhYdh1s80K4gRQNrXOimhfPE,5,"These meat pies are so good, my friend from Australia said they're almost too good to be authentic because the ones he had in Australia were worse."
ChIJhYdh1s80K4gRQNrXOimhfPE,3,"This is the kind of places where you go once and then you completely forget.  The pies are good, nothing exceptional, but VERY pricey ($15 CAD for two small pies!!!).
The pepper steak is good and comes with some chunks of meat, but the original (ground beef) is more gravy than meat...
Very disappointed..."
ChIJx2sC4dM0K4gREJyRW3vdakw,5,"Amazing service, wonderful food. Great selection of drink and the specialty drinks taste great. Top it off with the buck a shuck or two dollar cocktail shrimps, and you have a great time."
ChIJx2sC4dM0K4gREJyRW3vdakw,4,Went here for my wife‚Äôs birthday. Cool place and tasty food. Dishes were little bit too simple for the price.
ChIJx2sC4dM0K4gREJyRW3vdakw,5,The food and service were excellent. Our waiter Gabriel was THE best and helped make my birthday perfect.
ChIJx2sC4dM0K4gREJyRW3vdakw,5,"Fantastic meal and excellent service.  My steak was cooked perfectly.

Note, their crab cake is not the best.  Texture was similar to a overcooked hamburger."
ChIJx2sC4dM0K4gREJyRW3vdakw,5,I have loved oysters and shrimp for quite a long time and so while staying overnight on my own before an excellent presentation by Fidelity Investments at Roy Thomson Hall I decided to cross the road having heard they had a happy hour special. Buck a shuck oysters and $2 jumbo shrimp. Enough said. It was OUTSTANDING!!! I will make this my next stop when in TO and also look at what they offer for dinner too. If it is anything near the service and quality that I found yesterday then they have a fan for life.
ChIJcx1yDsM0K4gRnX8faXSfHuQ,5,"One of my favorite Pho places. Open 24 hours, quick service, regular proper and polite people. Most importantly, delicious food! All the condiments one needs on the side to warm the belly. Keep in mind it is CASH ONLY. Love the seat yourself option. Highly recommend."
ChIJcx1yDsM0K4gRnX8faXSfHuQ,5,"Hahaha, how do you not know this place if you are a night owl??? This place open 24 hours at China town a few doors next to dragon city. Must try this place, will not disappoint you! The soup is always fresh"
ChIJcx1yDsM0K4gRnX8faXSfHuQ,5,Solid pho and consistent despite being open 24 hours! Great option for a hearty breakfast or late night snack.
ChIJcx1yDsM0K4gRnX8faXSfHuQ,4,"so if you're like me and you've wandered around in the middle of the night when most places are closed then you might have found your way to this 24 hour restaurant.

1. the best part about this place is it is 24/7
2. the place is a little dingy but let's be real. if you're out at 4 or 5am you're not looking for how good the interior is. personally for me it gives me a ""hidden away restaurant"" vibe
3. the proportion of the food is bigger than other places of the same size. however the price might be at least a dollar more than other places. i might be wrong on that. gotta double check. also be aware that ""snacks"" like deep fried springrolls can be a whole meal by itself.
4. lastly the food. as pho lovers we all know the places with the best pho that have the best sweet sour savoury clear soup. If you're looking for that then this isn't the place for you.
Honestly it could use a tweak and a bit more skimming of the soup, but there's this strange uniqueness to the taste that keeps me coming back. 
I also find myself very comfortable eating here than other places. maybe it's nostalgia of all those years of wandering the night where i just wanted to be left alone to eat in solitude? maybe it's the same reason as how people know there are better burgers out there and yet keep going back to McDonalds?"
ChIJcx1yDsM0K4gRnX8faXSfHuQ,4,"Only place that‚Äôs available throughout the night so if you want pho this is the place to go.
I understand that many restaurants give tap water but the taste of their tap water was so obvious that I could really drink it.
They made up for that with their excellent service and decent food ( plus it‚Äôs 24h )
4 stars!"
ChIJS6TSi9Y0K4gRhnLajfL7RVY,5,"This place was perfect. Although I did not feel as if it was a top notch high end restaurant it gives you everything plus more. 

The service was great and the drinks were out of this world! 10/10 

We ordered both types of 3 courses. Was both great but the indigenous course was amazing. I fell in love on the first bite. Each bite broke down more flavors then the one before. As if I was in a dream eating my perfect meal. I come from Chicago and love cooking and food and this was my favorite part of Canada. 

Looking at the city enjoying a perfect time with no worries made me feel so at ease. After the meal you get the sky deck for free so why spend money to just view if you can get the whole package."
ChIJS6TSi9Y0K4gRhnLajfL7RVY,3,Average food. Average service. Definitely not worth it if you don‚Äôt get to sit on the tables by the window. The dishes we were served in were actually quite sad and definitely need to be upgraded. I would recommend just buying the ticket and going up the tower if you want and spend the rest of your money well by going to a nicer restaurant close by... that‚Äôs probably a better plan
ChIJS6TSi9Y0K4gRhnLajfL7RVY,5,"Went here to celebrate a birthday. Surreal experience. This is definitely top of the line. If you want to wow someone, you get them a dinner at the 360 restaurant around sunset time. The night view is an incredible vibe and the food choice is pretty good for a high end fine dine. I‚Äôve tried the duck here, with their cheesecake dessert and I was quite satisfied. The service is exceptional, of course. You have to be ready to drop some good money on your meal because it‚Äôs the experience that you‚Äôre paying for. I would recommend going here for big events, reunions or birthdays."
ChIJS6TSi9Y0K4gRhnLajfL7RVY,3,"If you‚Äôre a tourist and want to see the CN Tower, booking a lunch/dinner reservation at 360 is *very* worth it. The reservation will let you take the elevator to the revolving restaurant at the top (no line up!) and then direct access to the skywalk underneath. 

View is AMAZING. Food is average. I think it‚Äôs worth it, you get perks of the ambience more than anything else."
ChIJS6TSi9Y0K4gRhnLajfL7RVY,3,"Revolving restaurant with a very nice view above Toronto! I ordered a fixed menu, which includes the entrance fee to the observation deck one level down. The food was nicely presented, but nothing special or extraordinarily good in taste. I was missing spices! In my opinion the service was quick and pushy concerning the tip!"
ChIJYZ-WAS3L1IkRiynaqBHsQZs,4,Great hidden location tucked away on front street. Easy to miss but fairly spacious once you walk in. One of the easier locations to find seats on a Friday afternoon after work. Drinks are standard downtown prices but there are specials on most days. More of a drinks plus snacks place than a dinner spot.
ChIJYZ-WAS3L1IkRiynaqBHsQZs,5,"I work with an International Charity Organization. Recently we hosted a pre-event VIP party at The Bottom Line. This was part of a large fundraiser event we were running at the Hockey Hall of Fame. What an amazing way to kickoff this vital annual fundraiser initiative for us. The VIP party at The Bottom Line was the second year we hosted there, so we knew we could depend again on Wayne, Matty and the rest of TBL crew to provide an unforgettable experience for our guests. Another great success. Thank you so much!"
ChIJYZ-WAS3L1IkRiynaqBHsQZs,3,As a visitor from out of town we were pleased that we were able to walk in and get a seat without waiting before a Leafs game but we were all a little disappointed with the portion sizes.  I have had appetizers larger than the main course ! received outside of the city.  Because of this I won't go back and instead try a different place that might inch closer to my expectations
ChIJYZ-WAS3L1IkRiynaqBHsQZs,5,"Amazing place, amazing staff, margaritas are delicious and Wayne is the best :) If you need to cool down during this hot summer you should definitely come in bottom line, sit at the bar and have a cold lagunitas IPA. ;)"
ChIJYZ-WAS3L1IkRiynaqBHsQZs,4,Good atmosphere.  Love going to this place before a leafs or raptors game.  Wonderful staff.  Love the simply menu and great selection of beers.  Totally recommend it.
ChIJg8QKis00K4gRxBmvInxa51o,5,Been there twice. & I was very much pleased. They are consistent with their service. The food is always delicious. A comfortable place to pass a good time. I will go back again for sure.
ChIJg8QKis00K4gRxBmvInxa51o,4,"Came here tonight and stayed for a while to catch the game.

Pros:
- server was super nice
- place was funky with cool decor, and very comfortable
- great drink selection

Cons:
- food was just okay. Had the 10oz steak and I was disappointed with how plain the steak and the side was, especially given at that price point it should be pretty decent
- our server was nice, but there was noticeably long gaps between her checking in on us. I notice her section seemed to be much larger than it would be for a normal restaurant

I would come back, but I wouldn't be excited about it. It's a comfortable place to have drinks and chat, but the food isn't going to blow you away."
ChIJg8QKis00K4gRxBmvInxa51o,5,"consistently excellent. Service is friendly and the menu has great options at many price points. The vibe is casual but the kitchen clearly takes their job seriously. It's always interesting to see how Toronto restaurants carry themselves after being open for a few years.

Pro tip- if you love their meat program (including their excellent burgers), you can order them to be delivered to your house through their West Side Beef Co extension."
ChIJg8QKis00K4gRxBmvInxa51o,5,"Stumbled upon this place as every other place was packed for the Game 6 Raptors game. Would like to say, it was a great experience and their service was great and thanks for them to allow us sitting on the patio to watch the game. The drake burger was delicious and will definitely stop by there again."
ChIJg8QKis00K4gRxBmvInxa51o,5,Amazing food!! I‚Äôve been a few times and never disappointed. Friendly staff and lovely atmosphere. Food is just fab!
ChIJdfCcBsI0K4gRwxAyCzI_VGw,5,"Amazing food and kind owner!! 

I was asking the owner some questions and he was open about sharing some cooking tips with me! This is what veganism is all about! 

My friend and I loved the spinach and basil crepe so much that we came back the next day and ate the same thing! Also loved the 42 ingredient salad. Yum yum yum."
ChIJdfCcBsI0K4gRwxAyCzI_VGw,5,"Great food! The service was very friendly. At first, the salad bowl didn't have any sauce on it, so I asked for it on the side (I'm a sauce guy). The server let me know it isn't necessary since each items in the bowl are packed with their own flavour. She was right!"
ChIJdfCcBsI0K4gRwxAyCzI_VGw,5,Great Gluten Free Buckwheat Crepes! Even had savory options. Fresh squeezed juice and smoothies. All were very good.  Not too sweet not too salty. Would go back again!
ChIJdfCcBsI0K4gRwxAyCzI_VGw,5,"Super friendly staff. We had to change my friend's order a few times and they were very understanding. Cute atmosphere inside, nice music. Cool deco. Nice natural light. Good seating space outside and sort of small inside but still a good amount of seats if you get there early or go mid day. The food was yummy. Will definitely be back to try more."
ChIJdfCcBsI0K4gRwxAyCzI_VGw,4,"Really good food. Delicious smoothies as well with your favourite choice of milk, I had coconut milk. Well priced and awesome service. They have a soup and salad for brunch that was really filling and tasty. I will definitley go back again whenever I'm in the area and in the mood of some good vegetarian food."
ChIJYY4qFdM0K4gRDydzDiP-VAE,5,"Newly redecorated, they added new elements, and opened up the lobby. Not too fond of the weird chandeliers, they could have chosen something that flowed better with the original design. The carpet on the mezzanine looks like it was scribbled in by small children. The original clock was saved, from the spiral staircase, and is now displayed over the champagne bar in lobby. Quite a beautiful hotel, join their loyalty program, they don't ask for email or passwords, just a DOB to track the account."
ChIJYY4qFdM0K4gRDydzDiP-VAE,5,"Great location in downtown Toronto.  I recommend a suite. Nice dining locations at or near the hotel as well. The suite I stayed in had a very nice Victorian feel, right down to the door trim. The bed was plush and very comfortable. The staff and room service was very pleasant and the food was spot on. If you can afford it I highly recommend this hotel."
ChIJYY4qFdM0K4gRDydzDiP-VAE,4,"Great location opposite Union Station. Good hotel, rather cavernous and in places in need of repairs. I got a ""refurbished"" room which was generally very good:  clean, modern and roomy. The only downside was it was hard to sleep at night due to loud guests in the corridors coming back from bars and casinos. Overall though, a good hotel."
ChIJYY4qFdM0K4gRDydzDiP-VAE,5,"Absolutely beautiful renovations. Nice pool and fitness facilities. The locker room was great with a steam room and full showers. All of the meeting spaces we're gorgeous. The staff was amazing and friendly.

The location is convenient with access to the Path, Union Station, and a 10 minute walk to the convention center. It's nice to stay at a hotel with some history and top notch amenities. I really enjoyed my stay and the change of pace from the more modern hotels."
ChIJYY4qFdM0K4gRDydzDiP-VAE,5,"The staff was incredibly helpful! The hotel is clean and beautiful. We have been traveling with my 92 year old Mother, and they willingly allowed us to check in as soon as we arrived, so my Mother could rest from the trip. They lent us a wheelchair to use for her when we walked to eat at a restaurant nearby. I would highly recommend this hotel, and hopefully will be able to come back to stay here in the future. (We are from Texas)."
ChIJCY6ScbE0K4gRVKncxW5Gylk,5,I came back after years of not having been to this place when I moved out of the downtown core. The service remains impeccable! maybe even better actually. My fave dish - sashimi don was exactly as I remembered fresh and tasty - which is the reason why I fell in love with it in the first place. I agree with everyone this place is a hidden gem. Thank you Tokyo sushi for remaining consistent with your impeccable service and food.
ChIJCY6ScbE0K4gRVKncxW5Gylk,5,A tiny little spot on St. Joseph but great great food.  The best part is since it is hidden on this side street only people who know how great it is or by recommendation go there.  So the quality of food and service does not deteriorate.  I also appreciated the manager's very polite and professional service approach.   Great food and serviceüëçüëç
ChIJCY6ScbE0K4gRVKncxW5Gylk,4,Roll was good and I like the rice ball. The don isn‚Äôt that fresh. Maybe I just have too high standard. But this is definitely a to go place if you want a casual meal on a normal day
ChIJCY6ScbE0K4gRVKncxW5Gylk,5,"One of the best restaurants in Toronto. Excellent food, affordable prices and very good service. Elliot makes us feel like home. He is very kind, gentle and is engaged to keep the quality level of this beautiful place. I'm returning to my country but I'm gonna miss this restaurant forever. All the best for you guys."
ChIJCY6ScbE0K4gRVKncxW5Gylk,4,Love it...love it...love it.  Food was very good and service was super.  My only comment....just some musty smell I noticed when we walked in.
ChIJ5SAhacI0K4gRcZIhQKAyDTs,4,"Excellent fish and chip spot. Food  is tasty and very reasonably priced. Staff is mostly friendly. Decor is so-so at best.
Absolutely the worst thing about this place is that they don't have real knives and forks. Just plastic ones even when eating in. I don't know how the environmentally friendly folks in The Market haven't made them change this stupid practice."
ChIJ5SAhacI0K4gRcZIhQKAyDTs,5,"One of the best battered fish in the city, chips are not bad. Miss Vickie‚Äôs Batter is definitely worth the extra charge. They make their own coleslaw and tartar sauce. Spacious inside. Battered mushrooms are good as well."
ChIJ5SAhacI0K4gRcZIhQKAyDTs,5,"Delicious fish and chips. Their hospitality is amazing. 
I had to wait for several hours because the late departure and they didn't mind us staying until we had to leave.
Thank you"
ChIJ5SAhacI0K4gRcZIhQKAyDTs,5,Really good fish and chips.  There is a good selection of fresh fish.  Had the cod n chips.  The batter was light and the cod nicely cooked and flaky.  A definite return to this place if back in Kensington Market area.
ChIJ5SAhacI0K4gRcZIhQKAyDTs,5,"I love Fresco's, my partner and I have been going for yearsn. The food is fresh, a lot of their food is bought within the market. They have a decent selection of different foods, fish and chips (haddock, cod, salmon), crab cakes, fried sides like onion rings and deep fried pickles. I highly recommend the clam chowder!!"
ChIJNXfZFtI0K4gRNqVxEHaYy0Y,5,"Just camped out at the bar for the Raptors Parade at the University Ave. location. Staff was incredible as the event wore on into overtime. Attentive and understanding despite the crowds; true professionals. It was tremendous to be a part of that day celebrating people at the top of their game, and the Libretto staff were at the top of theirs. Plus the pies were dope of course."
ChIJNXfZFtI0K4gRNqVxEHaYy0Y,3,"I ordered a rucola salad with walnuts and pears as well as a white pizza with mushrooms and different cheeses. The taste was good. I didn‚Äòt like the loud music in the restaurant. The service was friendly, but kind of put-on with an insincere smile."
ChIJNXfZFtI0K4gRNqVxEHaYy0Y,5,It's a very nice restaurant. They make Neopolitan pizza! So many choices. Crust and vegan options! Great service! Wonderful atmosphere! Thank you for a great experience!  Good prices for the quality.
ChIJNXfZFtI0K4gRNqVxEHaYy0Y,5,Such a wonderful and homie place. Very good vibe and it‚Äôs clear everyone here is treated with such respect and is very happy to work there. Service is great and food is delicious.
ChIJNXfZFtI0K4gRNqVxEHaYy0Y,5,Awesome pizza. Fresh ingredients. Stone oven baked. Their hot oil is house made and is also really good.
ChIJu-5E3tM0K4gRJWzuyx4ofWY,5,What a wonderfully tasteful well-appointed dining venue with gracious servers and plenty of personal space. I met a friend for a fantastic lunch. The Mediterranean Bronzino was amazing with it's accoutrements. The dark cherry gelato was delightfully paired with Stratus Ice wine and a cappuccino. Compliments to the staff and the chefs. I highly recommend this venue for business or a lovely lunch.
ChIJu-5E3tM0K4gRJWzuyx4ofWY,5,"Sunday brunch is one of the best in the city. Huge selection of foods and bottomless mimosas. Very beautiful ambiance and atmosphere. You can spend a few hours here on a Sunday enjoying with friends. It is a buffet style selections include: omlete bar, seafood bar, meats, cheeses, deserts, pancakes, and more. 

Warning: this does not apply to brunch on Saturdays which I found to be average. You should definitely book a few days in advance as the Sunday brunch usually sells out."
ChIJu-5E3tM0K4gRJWzuyx4ofWY,2,"Have dined here several times before, but this time was a miss.  Prix fixe tasting menu was just not good, not worth it.  Went downhill after amuse bouche.  Pea soup bland, fish dish for main seemed like bar food.  Five year old could have made the desserts-cubes of watermelon alternating with whip cream served with raspberry sorbet!  Host was excellent, but waitress lacked warmth."
ChIJu-5E3tM0K4gRJWzuyx4ofWY,2,"Food was underwhelming, under seasoned and under sized. Desert was very good, but that alone did not justify the price. The cut in half zucchini was just a super bizarre dish. Service wasn't that great either nothing super wrong with it was just slow."
ChIJu-5E3tM0K4gRJWzuyx4ofWY,1,"Not great service, fairly average food, tiny portions (I've never complained about portions at any restaurant before). Plus, as an added bonus we got to witness the chef, manager and others swarm the table of 2 next to us all while our server vanished. I had to interrupt the chef's patronizing and ask him to move so that I could find our bottle of wine and refill our glasses. He seemed like it was an inconvenience. We're guests at the hotel and it is quite nice. Toca less so."
ChIJ-QiloMQ0K4gRh8RG0fb9Jt4,5,"The food was fabulous, the staff were even better! Michael was so very patient with our questions and allergies! Everyone had a lovely meal each dish was clearly created with an artistic edge to it."
ChIJ-QiloMQ0K4gRh8RG0fb9Jt4,5,"An appropriately ambient location that specializes in authenticity and zero tolerance for cutting corners. Staff is highly knowledgeable, well trained and engaging. Meals are prepared quickly and are intended to be shared amongst others. If you're in Toronto, you should visit. Better yet, bring a friend or two. They will thank you later."
ChIJ-QiloMQ0K4gRh8RG0fb9Jt4,5,"We‚Äôve never had a good dish here, because they‚Äôve all been GREAT. The food is phenomenal, as is the service. The only disappointment that amazing dishes get replaced by other amazing dishes on the menu from time to time."
ChIJ-QiloMQ0K4gRh8RG0fb9Jt4,5,"One of my most favourite dining experiences. I found this place accidentally and decided to take some visiting family here for a nice dinner and this place and ambiance is unpretentious but coupled with attentive and professional service. We enjoyed the cocktails but we absolutely loved the food!  the duck IS amazing, and the bao buns (the sweet ones that the server recommended) were so yummy. The lobster was a treat as well. We ordered a bunch of dishes all to share and it was a great night with great food and drink. I continue to come here for a nice dinner once in a while or a nice occasion. Great job"
ChIJ-QiloMQ0K4gRh8RG0fb9Jt4,5,"This is a lively happening place with very tasty dishes.  The BBQ Pork bun is my love at first bite.  It's so different from others, light crispy but soft shell with super flavorful fillings.  The Peking duck is so succulent and deliciously different from the traditional version.  Then there is the leg of lamb in a flavor exploding saucy broth together with udon noodles.  What a fantastic combination!  There are so many more items on the menu, I wish my stomach had more room.  Definitely next time!  The staff is well trained for great service."
ChIJ0_98bsI0K4gRtBL03UmwK0Q,5,"My daughter and I love King‚Äôs Caf√© in Kensington Market.  It is one of our favorite vegan restaurants.  We‚Äôve enjoyed everything we‚Äôve tried there.  Our favorites are:  curried vermicelli, Tom Yang noodles, vegan duck and vegan crispy chicken.  Also the drum-sticks are excellent and the dim sum is good.  The menu has a good Pan-Asian selection.  Sadly, they don‚Äôt have a great selection of desserts, with only a couple of vegan desserts.  The service is excellent.  The place is clean and well looked after.  The prices are good."
ChIJ0_98bsI0K4gRtBL03UmwK0Q,3,"King's Caf√© serves average Chinese vegan/vegetarian food. Staff are kind. Location is spacious. There are a few locations throughout the GTA, as part of its sister restaurants. 

I visited on multiple occasions. Certain items can be very oily and high in sugar. Steamed dim sum is okay. Nothing to write home about. Overall, it is not a bad option if you are seeking a vegetarian/vegan option with no onions and garlic. 

I do like the availability of vegetarian/vegan groceries. With that said, it is slightly more expensive than other King's Caf√© location"
ChIJ0_98bsI0K4gRtBL03UmwK0Q,5,What an amazing gem. There is so much variety to choose from on the menu. The food is delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable. The staff is super warm and welcoming. The washrooms are spotless and they have a little Chinese vegan grocery store inside the restaurant. What more can you ask for??!!
ChIJ0_98bsI0K4gRtBL03UmwK0Q,5,"Amazing food! Great service! Went during the day and I think there were only two other occupied tables. Hot, fresh, extremely tasty food and great service! Would definitely return and recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal (with vegan options on the menu)!"
ChIJ0_98bsI0K4gRtBL03UmwK0Q,5,"They have the best mock meats. It barely feels vegan in fact, and the menu is quite big and diverse. 10/10 never disappoints"
ChIJ7ZeFXso0K4gRqGxxcej0DjY,4,"A selection of hearty seafood dishes for the main course makes Donatello a satisfying place to visit. Their rack of lamb was prepared just right. 

They also offer a private event room on the second floor that comfortably sits fourteen guests. It worked out very well for our birthday party.

Overall was a very pleasant experience, and would definitely visit again. A solid 4.5 stars experience."
ChIJ7ZeFXso0K4gRqGxxcej0DjY,5,"Frequent traveler - This is a cozy cafe reminding me of San Francisco with the layout. They are conveniently located in Downtown next to an English pub. The service was amazing. We came on a Wednesday without reservations and were seated immediately. We had a variety of dishes plus desert. Our waiter, William, told us about the specials they made our night. My son had a New York steak with roasted potatoes and vegetables. I had eggplant rolls which was an appetizer but I ate as a meal. They made special tea for my Aunt and plain spaghetti for my daughter. They were incredibly accommodating plus gave us tourist ideas. They have an extensive drinks menu. We had the Royal Chocolate Truffle cake for desert which was just one of several choices."
ChIJ7ZeFXso0K4gRqGxxcej0DjY,5,"Pricey but very accommodating and everyone who worked there were all nice. The food is also absolutely delicious with big portions and absolutely worth the price.

I ended up with a dish that wasn't on the menu but I asked if they had anything with Angel Hair in it and the chef made what they could with it, if that's not accommodating I don't know what is."
ChIJ7ZeFXso0K4gRqGxxcej0DjY,5,This quaint Italian cuisine restaurant in downtown Toronto is a true gem. From the decor to the fantastic and attentive staff completed be the chef that as always exceeded our expectations. Please if you get the chance don‚Äôt pass this restaurant up.
ChIJ7ZeFXso0K4gRqGxxcej0DjY,5,"Try the crab meat ravioli.  Probably the best ravioli I have ever had, and the sauce is exquisite.  Use the bread to soak it up, trust me, you will not regret your choice.  Prefer something else, try the lamb or the spaghetti, add a glass of wine, its the perfect dinner date!!"
ChIJGURRlsM0K4gRvjF3bakHYNM,4,"Had great service and good food. 

The steamed dumplings are amazing as well as possibly the best General Tao I've had so far. 

The pan friend dumplings were less good and quite salty though. 

But as far as I'm concerned if you stick to the steamed dumplings and other dishes everything was really good!"
ChIJGURRlsM0K4gRvjF3bakHYNM,5,"I really think this is the best dumplings in town. Their dumplings are so tasty and full of flavor from the boiled to the fried ones. Also a great selection of other Chinese dishes. 
The seating is limited and on weekends there's always a line up but It's worth the wait. 
Service is quick because it gets crowded so they want people in and out.
Only cash accepted!"
ChIJGURRlsM0K4gRvjF3bakHYNM,1,"The dumplings are alright but greasy (so are their chopsticks and plates), HOWEVER the service is beyond terrible. I'm Chinese and I'm used to having poor service as you go to Chinese restaurants for the food, not the service, but this restaurant a whole level worse. I've been here several times but this time was the worst service I've ever seen in my life. When we sat down (group of 5), they gave us one menu. After several minutes a waitress literally slapped down a pile of menus and walked away. They gave us plates and small dipping plates but upon taking our order she took our dipping plates away despite ordering dumplings and told another waitress that we're ""only ordering two things"" in Mandarin and assumed I didn't understand. We ate pretty quickly and when the bill came a waitress rudely kept saying ""give it here already"" and then complained that we didn't tip enough and the total doesn't include tip. I said that's all we're giving as the service was terrible and she demanded more tip. I informed her tip is a choice and we're not giving more then she thew the change we had for tip back to me and said ""get out of here fast, get out of here fast. Don't ever come back!"" 

I've seen bad service in my life but this was wow. Tip is not a legal requirement...and they should really wash their utensils and plates better. Not sure how they have a Pass for Dine Safe."
ChIJGURRlsM0K4gRvjF3bakHYNM,5,"We had arrived late to Toronto, and after checking into our hotel, we ventured out to Chinatown to find something amazing-- and that we did. Dumpling House Restaurant was not only one of the only spots open late on a Friday night, but also had a wait (both promising signs). While waiting for our table, we watched the dough rolled, formed, stuffed and fried/steamed in expert hands. We were seated at a small table at the center of the lively and cozy restaurant, and ordered a mix of both fried and steamed dumplings-- lamb, spicy chicken, pork with scallions, shrimp with vegetable. Absolutely delicious, with quick and friendly service."
ChIJGURRlsM0K4gRvjF3bakHYNM,5,"Amazing dumplings. I chose the pick 3 option and we had seafood, pork, and lamb. I think the pork was the best and it was amazing. Dipped them in soy sauce and hot chili mixed together"
ChIJmx6Xk8o0K4gR_jkDCsG80SY,4,"Good place to spend money. :) Steaks are good. Wine is good. Is it better than other steaks I‚Äôve tried? Not really, but it‚Äôs definitely a good steak. The atmosphere and the staff are great. It‚Äôs a cozy quaint spot in the heart of Toronto. It gets lively in there, but that‚Äôs part of the experience."
ChIJmx6Xk8o0K4gR_jkDCsG80SY,4,"Located in the centre of Toronto with a classic interior and atmosphere. Visited on a Thursday, nice selection of beef on the menu and some pork and poultry choices as well. Servings are Canadian sized and meat is tender and taste was fine. If you are European and want a medium steak order medium rare. Staff are friendly, service is good and well paced. Premium prices."
ChIJmx6Xk8o0K4gR_jkDCsG80SY,4,"A classic, but not the best option at that price point. I recently returned to Barberian's for a special occasion and though it was a good time for all I couldn't help but think that at the price we were paying the quality should be a bit higher, the selection a bit more refined and the wine list better organized (it's an amazing list, but Italy could do with some level of subdivision). All the same, my steak was beautifully cooked and everyone had a great night."
ChIJmx6Xk8o0K4gR_jkDCsG80SY,5,"Amazing cozy little restaurant.  What a surprise, we had the rib steak and the chicken, the food was fantastic.  The chicken was flavourful and juicy, the steak was incredible.  Over and above the food, our waiter was fantastic, between the food and the staff, what an amazing experience.  On my list of one of, if not the best steakhouse experience."
ChIJmx6Xk8o0K4gR_jkDCsG80SY,1,"Most wasted money in my life! My mom and I ordered medium rare steaks. You'd think a place like that should know how to cook steaks to specific readiness. Nope! Mine was absolutely (and I mean absolutely!!!) rare while my mom's was between medium and well done. Mushed potato I ordered as a side was absolutely tasteless. I know there are different ways of cooking mushed potatoes, but this one had nothing in it but previously backed potato (no milk/cream, butter, salt, etc.). Rice that my mom had as her side was cheap tasteless type that was at least 2 days old. It was all clamped up and hard. When I made a comment about my steak to the server, he gave me such a grimace that I realized there was no point to even continue this conversation. No apology was offered at all. Save your money. Do NOT go to this place. There are plenty steak places in Toronto and can guarantee that absolutely any will be better than this place."
ChIJoRobZbU0K4gRAeRwPn2n0vU,5,"Food and service was awesome. Definitely partake of their mozzarella made in-house. We had the balsamic honey one. It was awesome. I had the smoked bacon and egg pizza, which was zingy but delicious. Portion sizes were perfect."
ChIJoRobZbU0K4gRAeRwPn2n0vU,4,"I have come here for both work functions and individual dates.  The food is quite good and the service is decent.  However, for some reason, whenever I am with a group, we are always seated at table 14 or 15 - by the kitchen which they try to sell as being cool because you watch the mozzarella being made.  However, you have to contend with other patrons coming by and standing by you or knocking your chair because they are watching the mozzarella.  Aside from those tables, I enjoy the restaurant."
ChIJoRobZbU0K4gRAeRwPn2n0vU,3,"We just arrived to the city after 14 hours in the plane, we were exhausted and really hungry!
But, our standards are really high when it comes to food.
So, we asked for recommendations and here we were, Italian restaurant and having lunch at 5pm!!
Waiters were friendly and food was good.
I would recommend you to go, if you are in the city for more than 2 days.
If not, I would say I have better options!"
ChIJoRobZbU0K4gRAeRwPn2n0vU,4,"Delicious food. Friendly staff. Cozy environment.

I recommend the butternut squash ravioli & the caprese salad (from what I‚Äôve tried anyway)

A bit pricey for an Italian chain restaurant. Like, pasta ingredients are fairly cheap you know."
ChIJoRobZbU0K4gRAeRwPn2n0vU,4,"I was here recently with my family. I will say the service over all was very helpful, fast and accommodating (we asked to move initially). I had their butternut squash ravioli and it was absolutely delicious. And very filling. I had their charity bread, but it wasn't as good as I remembered it. I wasn't really enjoying the powdered parmesan on top. I also found the location to be very dark. I understand mood lighting is a thing, but a touch more brightness I feel would be slightly more comfortable. But really not that big of a deal at all. I do prefer the charity bread and the ambiance of the Square One location better, though it's been a while since I've been to that location. Over all we enjoyed ourselves and the food was good."
ChIJmR5AnsM0K4gRlGIeZrA964k,1,"Avoid this place, they purposefully add random charges to your bill! They scribble their bills in Chinese so that you won't be able to read or understand. Bunch of thieves. We had a great meal and was about to pay and leave a great tip and return to this restaurant but now will never return here. Really horrible place. Ripping honest people out of their money!"
ChIJmR5AnsM0K4gRlGIeZrA964k,4,"Good food. Staff are fast and friendly with orders.  Can be busy at times, can always get take out.  If you like curry, and like it spicy, don't miss out on the curry beef with rice, always my fave !"
ChIJmR5AnsM0K4gRlGIeZrA964k,3,"Been to this Chinese noodle house tons of times before. Very fast service here, not too big on friendly though. They have tons of stuff to eat, from noodles to BBQ to fried noodles and rice. Everything is usually pretty tasty as well. This visit not so much. Came earlier and had some congee. Restaurant wasn't full by any means but food took much linger than expected. To top it off wasn't as good as usual. I still will return as I've been here tons of times before and they are usually pretty good so maybe this time was a one off. I also do recommend to anyone looking for an authentic Chinese noodle house experience."
ChIJmR5AnsM0K4gRlGIeZrA964k,4,"Walked in around 6pm on a Saturday night and luckily was able to be seated right away.  Got the #174 BBQ Pork on Rice and it was good. Some of the pieces of pork were more fatty than I usually like but everything tasted great. 
Food arrived quickly after ordering and Although getting the waitresses attention was a little difficult overall good service."
ChIJmR5AnsM0K4gRlGIeZrA964k,3,"Good, inexpensive food. We got a huge amount for our money! Interactions with the staff were rather confusing and not terribly friendly. If that doesn‚Äôt bother you, it‚Äôs a good place to eat."
ChIJ3__45ss0K4gRQ1rlA9WLlUY,4,Very good place to eat. Food is typical Korean. Tasty and reasonably priced food. Portions are big enough for anyone. Service is very good as well. The attendant was very friendly and helpful. The place is simply decorated and is clean and comfy. Will visit again.
ChIJ3__45ss0K4gRQ1rlA9WLlUY,4,"A bit pricey but the food and  the service is good.

They gave us 6 side dishes to start. After we finished them all, we were only able to choose 2 at a time. I guess they are try to reduce waste.

You will not go wrong with this place."
ChIJ3__45ss0K4gRQ1rlA9WLlUY,2,This place is ultra expensive and appetizers ( below photo) which are small pickles they charge extra Fee for Refill. First time ever i see this place charging extra for appetizer. The food itself is the same almost as other Korean restaurants and a bit extra Salty. So next time if you decide to visit choose wise. Across the street there is other Korean restaurant which serves same food and Free appetizer refill. üòâ
ChIJ3__45ss0K4gRQ1rlA9WLlUY,4,"Very typical Korean restaurant. However the food quality and prices are very good. The service is good and the servers are always checking to make sure everything is ok. However they only provide you with 2 additional side dishes and you cannot refill them all, even thought we had a table of 5. Otherwise everything else was good and the prices were decent for what you get."
ChIJ3__45ss0K4gRQ1rlA9WLlUY,5,"Great food and atmosphere. Excellent service. Kimchi just the way I like it, sour with a hint of sweetness."
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRIpDVnhmgUb8,5,"I think the best part of my visit there was the staff. Christian, the cashier was an absolute delight to speak to, he was well informed about the menu and generally just knew how to make people feel like this was the best place to be. Kudos to him. The food was amazing as well, the portions were huge and the Veggie Rainbow which was what i had made my tastebuds tingle with the mixture of all the sauces."
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRIpDVnhmgUb8,1,"For a place known for fries, i find the fries always under-cooked. I gave this place so many chances, but i wont be going back. Not even the cheese curds were melted! They were still hard and cold, and barely any grave at the bottom coating the under-cooked fries. I wanted to like you Smoke's, but sorry, not anymore!"
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRIpDVnhmgUb8,4,"Liked the Chicken and Waffles and Double Pork.  Background music was awesome- 80‚Äôs hair bands.  No wait, food served hot and fresh.  Now the bad- Bathroom was disgusting (which always makes me wonder about a restaurants cleanliness in general)."
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRIpDVnhmgUb8,3,"absolutely fine poutine place, each and every item is just marvelous and worthy of eating twice. the amount is quite satisfactory and the ambience is good as well. the one with beef and green peas would be one of the best ones. you can also try the one with bacon. My dish had just too much salt in it. i had to throw away half the food but without that aspect this is absolutely one of the best poutine place in Toronto, if not the best."
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRIpDVnhmgUb8,2,"For a place well known and only doing fries.
It did not live up to its name and standards for me. Fries were under done ( and soggy from the oil, wasn't close to the gravy ones). The cheese curds were not melted still hard.
And over salted gravy."
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRv7vo5hruH-I,5,"A great place that‚Äôs has been recently expanded and renovated. Super cute feminine style decor. Plush little velvet bar stools, plants and neon lights. 

I say at the bar and was entertained by Robert, which worked very well for me seeing as I was eating alone. 

The food selection was impressive, almost overwhelming (I like menus with just a few options). But incredibly delicious and just fresh, fun vegan food. 

I made a video of the place too, but can‚Äôt figure out how to upload it... ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Loved it!"
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRv7vo5hruH-I,3,"This place is beautiful setting. We have order a daily soup and power something. Forgot the name already. Alittle surprised that there were so much rice. No flavour at that too. Appears there are some dressing at corners, maybe minimal on the salad. Lucky there was a piece of lemon to give it some flavour on the rice. It‚Äôs not very flavourful, the soup was not hot and super salty. I don‚Äôt hate it."
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRv7vo5hruH-I,4,been a couple of times. its a nice atmosphere with patio. take out not the fastest. Service pretty good
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRv7vo5hruH-I,1,"I have been living on Spadina and King for  over 15 years and I've been going to Fresh pretty much since then.  It was one my family's favourite places to have lunch. I always loved to order the Beach bowl.  While the place has now notably changed, the portions are tinier and the prices are up 45%.  The bowl, which used to be about $13.50 is now $19.50. For $15.50 portion you have a tinier ""bowl"" for 1/3 of the previous small size. I understand that cost of living is high in Toronto; however, this is now a complete rip off. Good luck with these new changes and prices. I doubt that that you will be able to sustain a loyal clientele for the next 10 years."
ChIJG1ubn9s0K4gRv7vo5hruH-I,5,"Food was delicious and loved the earthy vibes!! Service was great too, one of our dishes was cold and a bit burned..it was replaced right away with little incident. Enjoyed our brunch!"
ChIJm3rwl8M0K4gRM-t7jIKZ75A,5,"Nice sandwiches with great price. They also have plenty of tasty side dishes and Asian desserts. If you're craving for Vietnamese sandwiches, should never miss this place"
ChIJm3rwl8M0K4gRM-t7jIKZ75A,5,Amazing cheap food. Love their banh mi cold cut and sausage! They have great meal packages like vermicelli bowls and rice bowls. Yummy yummy in the tummy
ChIJm3rwl8M0K4gRM-t7jIKZ75A,4,"Fresh yummy vietnamese sandwiches are available here. They have some spring rolls and other deli dishes to go. It might be little hard to go in at the beginning, but just go inside and ask if you are not familiar with the culture."
ChIJm3rwl8M0K4gRM-t7jIKZ75A,5,"Don't come here for the service, but for the food. Banh mi is cheap (3.50) with plenty of Vietnamese snacks on the side. Cash only, no seating area, but the quality of the food for the price is astounding."
ChIJm3rwl8M0K4gRM-t7jIKZ75A,5,"I grab a Banh Mi from here like twice a week. $4, always fresh, crazy fast. This place is incredible."
ChIJVy3VyEc1K4gRiKpRrdp7vyg,5,"This place just opened and it is quickly becoming my favourite go to place in the area. The staff are friendly and attentive. But even more than that, the food is absolutely delicious with great presentation. The setting is relaxed. Perfect for any occasion. Highly recommended."
ChIJVy3VyEc1K4gRiKpRrdp7vyg,5,"This is the by far the best sushi spot in downtown Toronto. 

The tempura is crispy, the rice is perfect and the fish is incredibly fresh. It felt like the sushi chefs at Kinoya were dedicated to making sure we had an authentic experience and we were not disappointed.

Excellent selection of sake as well - we will definitely be back soon!"
ChIJVy3VyEc1K4gRiKpRrdp7vyg,5,"No other way to summarize other than amazing, staff is incredibly friendly, service is great, food is spectacular.

The fish is some of the freshest I've ever had and the prices are great. 

Sung and his staff are 10/10. Highly recommend this place to anyone."
ChIJVy3VyEc1K4gRiKpRrdp7vyg,5,"10/10 would recommend to anyone. Great prices, great staff. The fish is incredibly fresh every time. Sung is a sushi master!"
ChIJVy3VyEc1K4gRiKpRrdp7vyg,5,"This place is honestly a gem. The price might seem steep at first, but everything is made with such quality and care! The tempura has the perfect crunch, the sushi has just the right amount of rice, the teriyaki steak is cooked just how you like it... Its definitely worth it! It's absolutely fantastic and I hope it sticks around."
ChIJy6ferCkyK4gRWt3Mve7og1Q,5,"Fantastic food. Tried the #18....the Turkish flat bread with 5 different varieties all packed onto one bread. It was unbelievably delicious. The bread was big enough for 2 people to share and try each offering. Cant say enough good things about this place. They do shared both style service so get ready to meet new people and enjoy this meal. Love the wonky cave theme inside. Staff was super nice and attentive.  Prices are fair, our bread was 18.00 or so. Love it here and cant wait to come back."
ChIJy6ferCkyK4gRWt3Mve7og1Q,2,"Taste is moderate, but the service sucks. We ordered the same item for 3 people and they served one by one. Once everyone's orders were served, mine was already cooled down. Also, I asked for knife and fork, they just left them together somewhere randomly on the table and moved away. The most annoying part was the paper plates they use. They cover the actual plate with a sort of folio and put a paper plate on it in which the dish is served. Not surprisingly, melted cheese stuck on it and I couldn't eat some part of my food. Use some real material and don't be lazy to wash the dishes please!"
ChIJy6ferCkyK4gRWt3Mve7og1Q,5,It worth a try . Then you'll be a loyal customer.
ChIJy6ferCkyK4gRWt3Mve7og1Q,5,"Awesome authentic food, friendly service."
ChIJy6ferCkyK4gRWt3Mve7og1Q,1,"worst service ever! They did not have soap dispenser. Washroom wasent clean.old fashion decor but creative. They make their portion smaller and no pitcher on the table and no service to serve wather!! If you want water they don't serve water by glass, they just give you a bottle of water and you should drink water by bottle. You will pay for restaurant but you will get a messy fast food service. I told all of these problem to servant but he said: "" my home is here and I do not use this washroom too, haha, about the water, it was my bad sorry but other things I don't care."""
ChIJIckrvGcyK4gRJ2lNTEcu0M4,5,"Just very delicious. Had two sandwiches,smoked meat is juicy as heck,delicious spices, mouth watering, wife loved the corned beef. Delicious matzoh ball soup,nice broth.  Coleslaw home made,nice marination,generous amount. Have a younger woman that greets everyone, beautiful smile. I'm disabled, I felt very welcome. Very friendly place,100% satisfied,so glad I went. Keep up up the good work. Feels like the 50's or 60's,love that. Should put some door openers on entrance way doors ,difficult to navigate."
ChIJIckrvGcyK4gRJ2lNTEcu0M4,4,"I had the corn beef sandwich special. It came with a generous size sandwich, which can be ordered lean, regular or medium fat, I ordered regular. The meal also came with a pickle and coleslaw. To drink I ordered a glass of ice water.

My meal came to $16.39 after tax. 
With tip be 

I'm not a coleslaw kind of guy so I didn't eat it.

Flavor. The corn beef was a little bit salty but nothing unbearable. Overall the meat was very tender. Although a little black pepper was needed. Overall mild flavor.

Flavor.............1 out of 2
Portions.........1 out of 1
Service...........1 out of 1
Atmosphere...1 out of 1

TOTAL............4 out of 5"
ChIJIckrvGcyK4gRJ2lNTEcu0M4,5,Fabulous food and owner super friendly. Place was packed but my take out was ready. Great portions. 1 sandwich can feed 2 people. Best deli in the city. Worth the drive and if your from out of town and love a jewish deli this is the place to go to
ChIJIckrvGcyK4gRJ2lNTEcu0M4,5,"Best deli in town. Roast beef sandwich is a must. Tuna melt and corned beef are good too! They‚Äôve been around forever, and you can tell ! They‚Äôve mastered smoked meat."
ChIJIckrvGcyK4gRJ2lNTEcu0M4,5,"The original Pancer family is back and the food is as delicious as ever.  My new ""old"" go to spot for corned beef and pastrami piled high - and I mean piled high - on fresh rye.  You gotta eat here..!!"
ChIJExALTdQ0K4gRbpnB-LrBIYc,2,"1 star for excellence in service. 1 star for decor. 0 for food. 
My Urban Salad was soggy, swimming in dressing - I wonder if the head chef forgot to inform the weekend junior team to assemble and present food with a hint of flavour - and the ""grilled"" chicken tasted boiled and then covered in pesto... there were grill marks though!
My (Korean) husband's Korean style chicken wings was missing any semblance to Korean style and flavours - it did have sesame seeds!"
ChIJExALTdQ0K4gRbpnB-LrBIYc,5,"Really enjoyed our dinner here. My wife and I loved our meals, and we even found something for our daughter (5), which is a rarity. Our waitress, Caroline I think?, was very friendly and attentive, and the venue had a great atmosphere. If I had to put in a complaint, it would be that the beer selection was a bit limited (but still satisfactory). Would definitely go back next time I‚Äôm in town."
ChIJExALTdQ0K4gRbpnB-LrBIYc,5,I don't review too often but just had to write a note about the spectacular service at this place. They made sure we were taken care of even when there was a huge table next to us that took up a lot of their time. Really appreciated how they made us feel as customers. Food was also delicious! Highly recommended.
ChIJExALTdQ0K4gRbpnB-LrBIYc,2,"Poor service, average food. Server did bare minimum and the food was just fine. For an outdoor patio, the location is perfect but the music playing was essentially the theme for Space Invaders from 1978. Such a lost opportunity. With so many other brunch options, do yourself a favor and pick somewhere else to go. Disappointing coming from a Delta property."
ChIJExALTdQ0K4gRbpnB-LrBIYc,2,"It was fairly unoccupied inside when I asked for a table for two for dinner. The host made it clear they 'need the table back at 6:30 for a fully booked reservation.' Then I asked for clarification because it was already 6:10. He didn't see it as a problem at all and said yes. So I again asked, you mean we need to leave in 20 mins? Which he said 'we are not kicking you out, we just need the table back.' ... Just no common sense with this host. We opted for the bar (which the host didn't even offer to begin with) because my friend really wanted to try the mac'n'cheese and the bar staff was top notch. But I will never actively seek this place to entertain friends again. Pictures are taken at 6:15 and then again at 7:15."
ChIJM4ap26DN1IkRE5y_XUbXV3c,4,The food was very good. I started with carrot soup and then had Butter chicken with a side of saffron potatoes. The saffron potatoes were exceptional and everything else was very good. The service was attentive without being annoying and my server was super helpful.
ChIJM4ap26DN1IkRE5y_XUbXV3c,5,Lovely place to meet for lunch. They have lovely wines by the glass we started sharing the sizzling tickka shrimp it was really sizzling when it arrived @ the table delicious. I then had 12hr braised pie short ribs really nice & tender. My friend had whole Mediterranean sea bass she really enjoyed it. I had honey moon dessert with a cappuccino. Everything was wonderful it was not to noisy so we could talk. 1st time there would return many interesting choises on the menu.
ChIJM4ap26DN1IkRE5y_XUbXV3c,5,Great service great food! Can't wait to go back again.
ChIJM4ap26DN1IkRE5y_XUbXV3c,5,"Consistently delicious! Even during Summerlicious/Winterlicious, when some restaurants' quality goes down to be able to service the quantity of patrons visiting their establishment, Diwan one keeps their level at the highest!"
ChIJM4ap26DN1IkRE5y_XUbXV3c,4,Beautiful setting and great atmosphere on Valentine's day. Live clarinet player and a huge 5 course meal was great value. The dishes were very unique and the braised lamb shank was outstanding. However the swordfish skewer as part of the salad was under cooked.
ChIJ5V02ks00K4gRYYwaCejHhEE,5,"Couldn't be more amazed on how great this location is, amazing service, friendly and funny staff. I showed up alone but left like I just made 15 new friends, would highly recommend going to this place, weather if it's for just a quiet dinner or to hang out with friends. The manager, Sabrina even took her time to take care of me, definitely a place to visit regularly."
ChIJ5V02ks00K4gRYYwaCejHhEE,5,"Went to this location recently with 5 adults, we also had our toddler and infant with us. The staff from the moment we walked in the door were excellent in ensuring everyone in our party had a good experience. 

I have never had such attentiveness to my children and their dining experience. From asking if we wanted my (2.5 year old) sons food brought out first to bringing him snacks while he waited. Having his needs addressed so fully ensured my husband and I could enjoy the delicious food fully."
ChIJ5V02ks00K4gRYYwaCejHhEE,5,"We love coming to the keg for dinner. The atmosphere is always very nice and the staff are very welcoming and friendly. The steak there taste very good and I always ended my dinner with the chocolate brownie. I especially love it when the brownie is warm and it is served with an ice-cream.

There werenonebtimebthatbthe brownie is completely cold, however the staff promptly exchanged a warm one for me. Excellent service as they care for customers, and we would definitely come often."
ChIJ5V02ks00K4gRYYwaCejHhEE,5,"I went here for a birthday celebration with my SO and we had a great time. The server was very friendly and professional. Their service was amazing.

Our steak meals were delicious and we got a free large slice of cake for his birthday. This cake was one of the best cakes I've had. I believe it was a cappuccino ice cream cake with other things and it was not very sweet. I'm pretty sensitive to sweetness and this cake was perfect for me."
ChIJ5V02ks00K4gRYYwaCejHhEE,5,"Great restaurant,  good food and great service. We had the honor of dining here after our wedding ceremony and it was an awesome experience. Amazing that they have a section you can use if you are coming with about 30-40 guests"
ChIJ1xDYP800K4gRr6xqHfSdxBE,4,"This place was hopping and I know why! The oysters were good and handled well but what a wonderful twist on the calamari! It came beautifully done in lettuce cups to give you the ability to eat it with the great sauces like a wrap if you like. Ambience was good, vibrant, real. Great spot for a night with friends or business peers. Small so get in early or make reservations."
ChIJ1xDYP800K4gRr6xqHfSdxBE,5,Loved the atmosphere and happy hour menu.  Will definitely be back!
ChIJ1xDYP800K4gRr6xqHfSdxBE,5,"The oysters, the scallops and the clam chowder, all delicious. Super recommended."
ChIJ1xDYP800K4gRr6xqHfSdxBE,4,"Good food, staff, music, cozy"
ChIJ1xDYP800K4gRr6xqHfSdxBE,4,"Cool spot... great food and oysters. Service was perfect..... attentive, informative but not overbearing at all which to me is how it should be always and everywhere."
ChIJe_yDRArO1IkR7y-paw9dzEQ,5,"This was the first time my family and I went here and the experience was wonderful!
When we walked in, we loved the decor and the staff were very hospitable and friendly, especially our waiter, checking by frequently making sure we were all comfortable and good.
The food also didn't take too long after we ordered, and was quite delicious (I recommend the PEI Mussels appetizer, and if you're going for dessert, their Cheesecake was just divine, it was soft and not too sweet).

Definitely a restaurant we will be returning to!"
ChIJe_yDRArO1IkR7y-paw9dzEQ,5,"We just left Smith Bros. I was hoping
for a new favourite restaurant and
I wasn‚Äôt disappointed! Right from when we sat down everything was perfect:) Brittany, our server, was impeccable and so nice:) The menu, the wine, the food... all perfect! We had prime rib cooked to perfection and we were surprised by a lovely birthday desert! And we had friendly visits from management to see how everything was, which was much appreciated:) We live within 10 minutes so it‚Äôs so great to find such a good restaurant so close by:) Thanks so much and see you soon:) ü§ì"
ChIJe_yDRArO1IkR7y-paw9dzEQ,5,"Great space between tables. Friendly staff and waiters/waitresses. Our waitress was very attentive, kind and pleasant. The food was very tasty. I would definitely go back."
ChIJe_yDRArO1IkR7y-paw9dzEQ,4,"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time on Saturday because I was craving steak. We each got our own ‚ÄúCompletes‚Äù that come with a starter, main and selection of desserts. The food and service was great up until we had to pick desserts. I wish our server paid more attention when we asked for ‚Äúno nuts‚Äù. Otherwise, dinner was filling, service was almost perfect, and I‚Äôll be coming back when I crave steak again."
ChIJe_yDRArO1IkR7y-paw9dzEQ,5,"We really like it here! Great for date night. The steak is cooked to perfection and so tasty. Good selection of wine and beer and craft beer. Service is always great. If you have room try the Chris & Adam‚Äôs Awesome Sundae 
with real hot fudge sauce we make from scratch!"
ChIJU66jsfjN1IkRT1L2OmzcI-M,4,This restaurant is great. The interior is renovated well and creates a nice korean atmosphere. The food is cooked just right and they allow you to choose your spiciness level. Prices here are very reasonable. The staff here are nice and quick.
ChIJU66jsfjN1IkRT1L2OmzcI-M,4,"Great food, but long wait to be seated during regular dinner time. We visit often when not too hungry. The side dishes change daily and are quite delicious. Since they do serve barbecue, do expect to leave the place with your coat smelling like food for a few days after. Parking is also limited. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the food is great with acceptable price."
ChIJU66jsfjN1IkRT1L2OmzcI-M,5,"Very happy with my visit to Makkal Chon (well, relatively speaking‚ÄîI went to a funeral immediately following lunch).  Nice atmosphere and the service was super friendly and efficient.  The food was excellent and the sides were the best I‚Äôve ever had in my many years of eating in Korean restaurants.  One of the best experiences I‚Äôve ever had with Korean food.  Highly recommended."
ChIJU66jsfjN1IkRT1L2OmzcI-M,5,"Good experience and cleanliness. A good hidden gem with authentic Korean food. Food is well presented and clean.
Ordered bibimbhap and wrap combo for 2. Lettuce wrap is very clean and kayed out. Mackerel well grilled. Their side dishes has given generous portions."
ChIJU66jsfjN1IkRT1L2OmzcI-M,4,"The place is small but selections pretty good. Bulgogi is delicious and spicy pork bone soup. The wraps are good too even their eel - little sweet be warned. 
I also tried sizzling beef ribs but it wasn't marinated properly as it wasn't that good.
They served this with appetizer included.
Price is competitive and liking the location by Lawrence and Warden in Scarborough.
One of the best Korean restaurants out there."
ChIJgYe5ifw1K4gRHVpKsd-cZLY,5,"So good, I got their curry noodle soup and it definitely hit the spot, so creamy but not too heavy, the service is really good and the hostesses were so kind. Welcoming environment and the decor is really beautiful. It was a nice touch that they served tea right as you sat down. Overall it had a great environment and DELICIOUS FOOD."
ChIJgYe5ifw1K4gRHVpKsd-cZLY,5,"Always a pleasant experience here. 

Food is great and reasonably priced. The amount is big enough to even be shared by two people. They have some nice appetizers including taiwanese pop corn chicken, stir-fried potato slices, seasoned cucumbers. 

Service is great. We went during lunch hour and they let us sit and talk for almost 3 hours, we definitely overstayed our welcome but it was nice of them to do that. 

Washroom is very clean as well. 

Will be back next time too."
ChIJgYe5ifw1K4gRHVpKsd-cZLY,5,It was fun putting the finishing touches on my own noodle soup and choosing what I want or don‚Äôt want to add. The pork chop was delicious! Interest contrast between the soft textures in the bowl and the crispy chewiness waiting to be bitten into. The service staff seemed a little inexperienced but made up for it in friendliness. Overall a great dining experience. Watch out for the hot bowl and a dash of hot-sauce in soup brings your tongue‚Äôs attention to all of the different flavours singing in harmony with appreciated warmth.
ChIJgYe5ifw1K4gRHVpKsd-cZLY,4,"Yummy food, nice decor, and very good prices, especially at lunch time. Highly recommend!"
ChIJgYe5ifw1K4gRHVpKsd-cZLY,4,"I really like this place. The food is comforting, soupy noodles. Imo, the food won't blow your mind but they have a home-y feel to it and is inexpensive. Would definitely recommend if its cold out and you want a cute, comforting and cheap meal. Will come again."
ChIJt7OCSivL1IkRn8Y08sEgUHc,4,"The square is home to Jurassic park which is an amazing atmosphere, especially during this run of the NBA finals. The shops around it offer over priced food and drinks, but that's the only downfall. It's a great time to gather with the Toronto community for sporting events."
ChIJt7OCSivL1IkRn8Y08sEgUHc,5,We went to watch the Raptor away game. A lot of excitement and energy. We felt very safe and had a great time. Just missed a thrown tshirt...
ChIJt7OCSivL1IkRn8Y08sEgUHc,5,Good thing they cost Raptors's Jurassic park which is awesome
ChIJt7OCSivL1IkRn8Y08sEgUHc,4,"Jurassic Park is incredible. Has concession stands for food, drinks, alchohol, and merchandise. Has porta potties. Big screen to watch the Game. One downfall is there's nowhere to smoke, and no reentry."
ChIJt7OCSivL1IkRn8Y08sEgUHc,4,Great atmosphere during Raptors and Leafs playoffs.
ChIJc7b06800K4gR3HnGJ5UFYxw,5,"Upscale Greek food. We opted for sea food options and we loved it. The octopus is amazing, so are the scallops and sea bass. Atmosphere is nice and quiet although on the summery day we were there the AC was out. Friendly service."
ChIJc7b06800K4gR3HnGJ5UFYxw,5,"Our server was extremely friendly and knew exactly what to recommend based on our preferences. Everything he recommended, we loved! The restaurant is beautiful and the food is delicious and full of flavour. I would definitely recommend going there for a special occasion or date night."
ChIJc7b06800K4gR3HnGJ5UFYxw,4,"Great ambiance!  I took out a group for business dinner here, and we all enjoyed the food.  The food price is decent for the quality.  Service is good too but our server was clearly split thin as the night got busy.  Overall, a good experience.

Even thought I was here for business dinner, based on what I noticed seems great for couples, date night dinner as well."
ChIJc7b06800K4gR3HnGJ5UFYxw,5,"Love. 
Great service, great food! We had a wonderful overall dining experience.
Made our reservation on OpenTable. Had no issues, our group was seated at an amazing table. Our server was fun and smiling despite the fact that it was a packed house. She was also wonderful with recommendations. 
We were all very pleased with the quality of our food, taste and portions.
Thank you Volos for an amazing experience."
ChIJc7b06800K4gR3HnGJ5UFYxw,3,Very stylish place as expected. Nice environment for some good conversation with few glasses of wine. Food was so so. My order of veal came with 2 piece of meat. One was over cooked a bit. The greens were also a bit too well done.
ChIJDUW-3cw0K4gRbhnTlLmb_fs,4,Very nice restaurant cozy place to enjoy a tasty meal. Family friendly with high chairs for children. Healthy meals on the menu creative presentations. My first time going there and would definitely go back with friends. Good service with a friendly staff. Located next door to the Bay on Queen st/ across from Eaton Centre.
ChIJDUW-3cw0K4gRbhnTlLmb_fs,4,"This spot is a very accommodating, accessible restaurant located right in the Eaton Centre! There's ample space for sitting and eating-in, and you can order from a diverse menu that isn't overbearing in choice. Service is quick and very friendly, and the servers do a great job at making recommendations for your meal. It's worth making a reservation, as the restaurant tends to get pretty busy in the evenings. Definitely worth trying if you're in downtown Toronto!"
ChIJDUW-3cw0K4gRbhnTlLmb_fs,4,We were a large group (12 people) this morning for lunch. Our server was excellent. Thank you! The food was fine though not inspired. I would return for the capacity to manage a large group with ease and accuracy.
ChIJDUW-3cw0K4gRbhnTlLmb_fs,4,The bannock box starter contained various kinds of flat breads and bread sticks and a dip similar to hummus. The breads were fresh and delicious. I had the margherita pizza which was made from a very thin crust and was excellent. My friend had a salad that was acceptable. Overall the menu tends toward conventional items and might be thought to lack imagination somewhat.
ChIJDUW-3cw0K4gRbhnTlLmb_fs,5,Everything is so good! Even the simple dishes like the grilled cheese and pancakes are delicious. We enjoyed the vibes and beer for a chilly Sunday brunch. I love the layout of the restaurant with the wine side and dine side. Perfect for anytime!
ChIJNVvTvYrVKogRSKvv1jOVeZw,4,"Great breakfast gem in the heart of downtown Toronto. Warm, bright and cozy with lots of seating and an extensive breakfast/brunch menu. Fast and tasty, we enjoyed the classic skillet - sausage, peppers, hash browns and very tasty mushrooms topped with eggs and a side of toast. The washrooms are a bit difficult to access as you have to exit the restaurant and ascend two flights of stairs after passing through the lobby. Our waitstaff were awesome and friendly."
ChIJNVvTvYrVKogRSKvv1jOVeZw,5,"Found this place accidentally while staying at the Royal York for Pride. Amazing food and service. I had the skillet which was delicious, and the waitress (who noticed my birthday pin) brought me a breakfast crepe with a candle in it. Many selections on the menu, will definitely return next time!"
ChIJNVvTvYrVKogRSKvv1jOVeZw,3,"I have been here twice. The food is great but servers are always cleaning the place with mops and they serve your food without washing their hands afterwards. Also, The place smells like detergents. So, if you don‚Äôt care where you‚Äôre eating your food and you only care about the taste this place is great."
ChIJNVvTvYrVKogRSKvv1jOVeZw,4,"We were looking for brunch and found this amazing place!! Poached eggs with any sauce and side are simply perfect!! Delicious food and great service, great start before going to the ROM.
Don‚Äôt miss: mushroom and cheese sauce with their signature potatoes and iced latte!"
ChIJNVvTvYrVKogRSKvv1jOVeZw,5,Phenomenal service and food! Seating was a bit strange but comfortable and diner like. Amazing food and the eggs Benedict were amazing. BUT THE HOME FRIES ARE TO DIE FOR. Best I've ever have. Bottomless coffee is a plus and I'll be returning to Toronto and specifically coming back to Over Easy!
ChIJ3-gXrtA0K4gRIjDscfiuerk,5,"What a lovely little restaurant. We had an amazing breakfast here.  What is even more of a delight is the decor.  The setting is beautiful and that kind of thing does not usually make a difference to me.  If in the area it is worth coming in.

I‚Äôm adding to this review.  We went for dinner and it was amazing.  The drinks were well prepared and the food both well prepared and presented.  An absolutely delightful little restaurant."
ChIJ3-gXrtA0K4gRIjDscfiuerk,5,Nice restaurant in a luxurious hotel. Great atmosphere and good food. Will definitely come back.
ChIJ3-gXrtA0K4gRIjDscfiuerk,5,"Had a wonderful romantic dinner at this lovely restaurant.  Excellent service by Laura. Quite hidden on a side street in the middle of a lot of construction.   Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, the ambience and evening, will definitely be back"
ChIJ3-gXrtA0K4gRIjDscfiuerk,5,Service and food to die for  staff so friendly and caring go out. Of their way to make it an evening you will never forget  I rate them 100 out of 100 way to go guys
ChIJ3-gXrtA0K4gRIjDscfiuerk,5,Great food and our server was incredible. Not a large restaurant so it doesn't get too loud. Bright inside and well decorated.
ChIJqyJwQ8o0K4gR_WNMtVoaxp8,5,"With four adults and a toddler in tow, we were easily seated at supper time without a reservation on a Wednesday. Where the menu is primarily √† la carte, I ordered the burger which included fries. The others in our party ordered the lamb chops, steak, and scallops. We were all well sated and very pleased with our meals. I see how this restaurant is named among the top ten in Toronto."
ChIJqyJwQ8o0K4gR_WNMtVoaxp8,5,Welcome lunch refuge from the wet fog. Excellent beers. We enjoyed mains dishes of scallops and octopus with fried cauliflower salad. Dishes were beautifully presented and the clean fresh flavours delightful
ChIJqyJwQ8o0K4gR_WNMtVoaxp8,4,"I ordered charred octopus and crispy sprouts. Octopus was delicious. Rhe crispy sprouts has the unique tastes. I think it is good for beer, but it was little bit salty for me."
ChIJqyJwQ8o0K4gR_WNMtVoaxp8,3,"So apparently this is one of the top 10 restaurants in TO.  I was expecting far more given the hype.  Octopus was tough, ambiance average.  Overall good not great.  Would I make a point of going again?  Probably not.  But I wouldn't abject if invited.  I was left feeling indifferent about my experience."
ChIJqyJwQ8o0K4gR_WNMtVoaxp8,5,The food is outstanding and pricing isn't terrible. The menu is just a little confusing but the staff are good at explaining & offering recommendations. Good with last minute groups too!
ChIJQY_nP9I0K4gRj0Fo9reXGQ4,5,"Incredibly. Awesome. Food. Oh my God this place has just fantastic food. We came to Toronto and happened upon it, and made it a point to go back here before we left. The food is just incredible. The place is a fantastic looking. It had a young trendy crowd on the patio outside in the middle of the financial district. Inside it is huge and very attractive looking.  My Cajun salmon was so good I had to get the same thing twice. However when I tried my daughter steak I was in love and thought next time I will absolutely have to get the steak. I will be looking for another Earls near me, I think there is one in Boston."
ChIJQY_nP9I0K4gRj0Fo9reXGQ4,5,"Great food and drinks. Our server was fantastic. She warned me that something I'd ordered was really spicy, allowing me to decide if i still wanted it. 

For fellow introverts, it's really loud and people-y here, but well worth visiting. The patio is comfortable and lovely."
ChIJQY_nP9I0K4gRj0Fo9reXGQ4,5,We enjoyed Earl's during our stay in Toronto. The atmosphere is great and they serve a full menu until late. We had the spinach dip and some other small plates to share. Everything was good and the menu is varied. We really appreciated the many plant-based options. We went back a second time for later night drinks and had a similar positive experience. Service is good. This was a great place to have so close to our hotel.
ChIJQY_nP9I0K4gRj0Fo9reXGQ4,5,One of the best restaurants in this area.  Really nice atmosphere.  The food was great.  Prices were very reasonable.  Staff were very friendly.  Great dining experience overall.
ChIJQY_nP9I0K4gRj0Fo9reXGQ4,5,"The boys and I went out for a bite after a Jays game. We were able to get a table for 6 as walk ins at 11 at night. 

Food and drinks were good and the server must have better hearing than I do because she didn't make any mistakes on the orders."
ChIJV61Q09E0K4gR74Bxz14wiBM,4,"Fast service, friendly staff. Not a lot of seating available at lunch but takeout is only a 5 min wait. Food is good as well, prices are a tad steep I think but that's likely a function of the area. I'll be back for sure.,"
ChIJV61Q09E0K4gR74Bxz14wiBM,2,"Quality not worth the price. Cuts of fish were a bit on the cheap side. Heard good things, but won't be coming back. Friendly service though."
ChIJV61Q09E0K4gR74Bxz14wiBM,4,A but pricey but everything in this neighbourhood is kind of expensive. Rolls and sashimi tasted good. Service was nice.
ChIJV61Q09E0K4gR74Bxz14wiBM,4,Nice cozy spot for a quick lunch. Service was fast. Sushi was fresh and tasted good. Reasonably priced. Coming back for sure.
ChIJV61Q09E0K4gR74Bxz14wiBM,4,Good sushi when one the run. Decent prices considering yorkville. Fresh and fast service.
ChIJg8Q6CrE0K4gRaobHJCOPjto,3,"Nice decor, fancy setting, however they served us spoiled shrimp. I understand this is a possibility, but quality control has failed. I have them a chance to remedy: they took item off bill with no further concession or comment.  I expect more from an alleged upscale Chinese restaurant located outside of ""Chinatown restaurants"". Get up to date with western standards!"
ChIJg8Q6CrE0K4gRaobHJCOPjto,5,The food here is really good but the decor is opulent.  It is really over the top and makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.  We went with a large group (over 30) and they accommodated is easily in the private dining room they have.  The staff were professional and really delivered a fine dining experience.
ChIJg8Q6CrE0K4gRaobHJCOPjto,2,"Underwhelmed at best
Having flown in from NY to eat Chinese food,  this was quite the disappointment. 

The fish was fishy
The scallops were overcooked and under seasoned 
Roast pork,Dry and unflavorful...

The rest was okay. 
The duck and vegetables were probably the 2 better dishes.  

Not having suckling pig but featuring it on the special menu was amateurish, considering the special menu is a one pager that they did not need to provide.

Only saving grace was the service."
ChIJg8Q6CrE0K4gRaobHJCOPjto,1,"I will give 0 star if possible.
They have sneaked random stuff on my bill for three consecutive times. By all means, it cannot be human error, just their way of making extra money. Their attitude was horrible when I pointed out the extra fake order,  blaming me for not pointing things out. 
Always check your bill item by item, if you still consider going"
ChIJg8Q6CrE0K4gRaobHJCOPjto,3,Nice furniture. Tired linens and china. A bit pricey. 40 dollars with tax and tip for one dish. No charge for tea and 2 almond cookies. The jumpo scallops was a very good size portion.
ChIJ5xZG3rE0K4gRvK1yTr80ajA,5,"This place is so easy to miss! It's so unassuming and tucked away, and I'm really glad a friend suggested I go here! I would never have known, and would have missed out on a great place.

Everyone is so polite and friendly, and the food is super delicious and very reasonably priced. Very cozy atmosphere as well!"
ChIJ5xZG3rE0K4gRvK1yTr80ajA,4,"It‚Äôs an nice little spot in a good location. It‚Äôs got a lot of open space so it doesn‚Äôt feel cramped at all. The food itself was okay and very affordable, and you can tell they‚Äôve got a great feel for the menu. However I‚Äôm not sure the ingredients are as fresh as they could have been, granted it‚Äôs tough to tell when it‚Äôs under a coating. Overall I really enjoyed this spot, and I look forward to coming back for a quick bite sometime soon."
ChIJ5xZG3rE0K4gRvK1yTr80ajA,5,The Food (Sea food Okonomiyaki) was great and service was super fast. Price is reasonable for two. Staff were very polite same as in Japan. Overall We are really happy for eveything. We will come back again. Thanks
ChIJ5xZG3rE0K4gRvK1yTr80ajA,4,"Was nice to try savoury Japanese pancakes. Ordered the chicken and shrimp pancakes, and green tea. The pancakes tasted good; was a bit salty for me but not bad."
ChIJ5xZG3rE0K4gRvK1yTr80ajA,5,"Delicious Japanese food! They gave us Nori (dried seaweed) in a shaker so you could have as much as you want. That's awesome!

The customer service was very friendly too."
ChIJryPxdrQ0K4gRCvPvr24FhjI,5,"Good food. Ours was a group of 4 people. We liked everything. The complimentary bread was warm and tasted good. Appetizer: we ordered a platter. Hummus was good. My friends liked the egg plant, I thought it was okay.

Main course. 
Kabob Platter: Lamb and chicken were good. 

For second main course dish, we ordered one pomegranate stew, that came with rice. It tasted good.

For shared meal of 1 appetizer and 2 main course dishes, shared between 4 moderate appetite people, the per head cost was $20."
ChIJryPxdrQ0K4gRCvPvr24FhjI,4,"Great variety of Persian foods including appetizer, main course, and dessert. They were well named and introduced in the menu in English. 
Restaurant has Persian style environment nice for the family to spend time. It is a good Persian restaurant accessible on Yong st. close to downtown. 
They have a TV there if you are planning to watch a live game.
Food was very delicious. It was a little pricey considering the quality and quantity, may be because it is located on Yong close to downtown.
Staff were very nice and treated us very well. They offered us free tea after dinner. They stayed longer as we were watching raptors game.
Thanks."
ChIJryPxdrQ0K4gRCvPvr24FhjI,5,Went there last night with a large group of friends and was thoroughly impressed by the service and food. Ryan and his team were kind and considerate with some of our dietary restrictions and did whatever they could to accomodate. They made us feel welcomed and would definitely come back. I highly recommend this restaurant :)
ChIJryPxdrQ0K4gRCvPvr24FhjI,5,"Service was top notch here. The owners were very accommodating to my son and I. Food was served quick and my kabob koobideh was juicy and hot, exactly the way I expected. Highly recommended"
ChIJryPxdrQ0K4gRCvPvr24FhjI,5,"Amazing food, very tender and fresh. Great and friendly service. Highly recommend!"
ChIJjRXFB640K4gRb4EiMDNEzAo,4,We came here for brunch and had so many different types of dishes to try.  I really like how they have vegan options (their chickpea dish as well as another stewed bean dish).  Everything was so delicious and very flavourful. I also really like how they have a tea room upstairs where you can enjoy some tea and desserts.
ChIJjRXFB640K4gRb4EiMDNEzAo,5,"The service was absolutely excellent! The staff were so friendly, helpful and courteous! The food was also amazing! I will definitely be back more than once! Thank you."
ChIJjRXFB640K4gRb4EiMDNEzAo,3,"Ok selection of middle Eastern food at reasonable prices. The quality has seemed to drop over time, but still a good place to grab a bite. The mango smoothie is a must have. My personal favorite is the planner kabob plate."
ChIJjRXFB640K4gRb4EiMDNEzAo,5,Awesome afghan dishes. The eggplant is so excellent that I almost started to forget my kabob! Worth every penny
ChIJjRXFB640K4gRb4EiMDNEzAo,4,"Environment is pretty clean and tidy, portion is large! The taste of the dishes over all are good! Just a little too salty for us! It is a nice place to take a try XD"
ChIJ53sEEsI0K4gRDPFl8bHsUxQ,5,Ive been eating these empanadas for 30 years love them. Very large and full of flavour. The chicken has hard boiled egg olives and loads of chicken extra yummy with their fresh salsa. Go and enjoy. I also really like the beef.
ChIJ53sEEsI0K4gRDPFl8bHsUxQ,5,Delicious and very hearty. My daughter loves it here and I went on a whim with her. Very clean restaurant which I really appreciate these days. I am always thankful when the staff also share that extra bit of care and they do. I highly recommend Jumbo Empanadas.
ChIJ53sEEsI0K4gRDPFl8bHsUxQ,5,This is the best place in Toronto for empanadas. We regularly revisit whenever we go there. Super friendly staff and great tasting food! Highly recommend!
ChIJ53sEEsI0K4gRDPFl8bHsUxQ,4,"I am not a huge fan of Chilean food, but this place is great! I ordered the sweet corn pie and it was delicious. This is a hidden gem that is worth checking out."
ChIJ53sEEsI0K4gRDPFl8bHsUxQ,4,"Very good empanadas, but no AC and it gets hot in there. Would definitely get the food again. Beef is better than chicken. Chicken was a bit dry."
ChIJyRlRaLU0K4gRatGG_keAqsM,4,"I like Vietnamese food, this was one of the first places that aimed to gentrify this segment of the restaurant market. I like the fusion approach, this could serve as a bridge to those having their first experience with Vietnamese food. Prices are a bit high when compared to when you pick up these same types of items in little mom and pop shops, but they package it in a clean and bright setting. If you're looking for good Vietnamese food, you probably could do better. If you're in it for a dining experience, sure, why not..."
ChIJyRlRaLU0K4gRatGG_keAqsM,4,"I really enjoyed the balance between meat and veg. The bread is super soft. I am a big fan of lean meat and the porc had a little too much fat, otherwise totally worth it. The walk from union took 25 min, no regrets!"
ChIJyRlRaLU0K4gRatGG_keAqsM,5,Unreal food. Proper attention to ingredients. Very very tasty. I constantly go to Banh Mi Boys locations when I am craving a properly made Bao and very fair prices. I often order way more than I need but enjoy every bite.
ChIJyRlRaLU0K4gRatGG_keAqsM,4,"The food is always good, the location right on Yonge is great. But I feel it is a little pricey for what it is. I get a lot more bang for my buck in Chinatown and more soul food, so will I keep visiting?"
ChIJyRlRaLU0K4gRatGG_keAqsM,5,Fantastic sandwiches! Line can be busy and they get through it really quick. Never had any complaints with anything I've tried
ChIJ75am68M0K4gRywTE5GXMPCw,4,"4 STARS üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü AWESOME
---
Absolutely love this restaurant. There is a reason why they've been around for such a long time and it's because it's a community favorite. The food is fresh and tasty. Staff are pleasant and the service is usually fast. It can be busy at times but the line goes fast. I highly recommend this location. üëç"
ChIJ75am68M0K4gRywTE5GXMPCw,5,The place was loud but that was to be expected of such a busy place. The variety of food was extensive and each dish was mouth-watering. I always recommend the curry cuttlefish because the dish is both unique and delicious. Great dim sum for a great value! Would 100% go again.
ChIJ75am68M0K4gRywTE5GXMPCw,5,"Food: 5 out of 5, Food is decent, not as fancy as uptown but very solid. If I have to be picky, I would say the clay pot rice could heated a little longer, so I could taste the cooked but not burned crispy rice. Other than that, no complaints.

Ambience: 4 out of 5, it's clean, cozy and decent place. It breaks the stigma of dirty downtown Chinese restaurants. Kids friendly too.

Services: 4 out of 5, they are friendly, only if you go there early, it's tough be friendly when you go there during the busiest time of the day.

Price: 4 out of 5, it's cheap. Dirt cheap for dim sum. 

Overall: 5 out of 5, To sum it up, cheap price with decent food, and OK services, what more can you ask for."
ChIJ75am68M0K4gRywTE5GXMPCw,5,"Best quality/value Chinese food.  This place is open until 4am as well.  If you are looking for quality at dinner or even after a night out, this is where to go.  It can be busy but they can accommodate a large number of people later at nights when the back room is open. Beef short ribs and BBQ Pork Buns are some of my favourites."
ChIJ75am68M0K4gRywTE5GXMPCw,5,"Dim sums to die for! I was walking around in China town. So many awesome restaurants,  cute little tea cafes and I stumble upon this restaurant. I am a vegetarian and I ordered stir fry vegetables dim sum. They were delicious! Soothing Jasmine tea just for dollar! And spring rolls! Love me some spring rolls! I am coming back with more friends!"
ChIJ0W8ERsQ0K4gRNJu8TsZGFxA,1,"Food was good, just like the other locations. Make sure to try the shredded pork with chili. But service was subpar. There was some kind of fly in the picked vegetable fish pot, and the waitress had no reaction except look up at the ceiling to see if the fly came from there. She didn't even apologize. We had to ask her to get another bowl, and she did that only. On top of that, the same server saw that we had two teapots, gave both of them a good shake to see how much was remaining, and left us with the one that was empty. Excuse me? We asked her to give us the other one back, and we watched as she gave the exact same one she took from us back- it was full. The older servers are extremely disrespectful to their co-workers, since we can understand what they were saying. I'll probably be sticking to the other Asian Legend locations."
ChIJ0W8ERsQ0K4gRNJu8TsZGFxA,5,"The food is amazing, we got it to go. (We were in a rush). It was ready so fast. It was hot, delicious, fresh, just absolutely perfect. The spicy üå∂ scale was accurate. Parking is available down the block (we have a giant truck).... we just used an above ground lot. You could park on Phoebe if it was the weekend/evening. (Free parking). The were extremely kind and gracious. Dad enjoyed the shrimp/pork wonton soup. (The meat was in the wonton). I got the spicy fried beef. Which was just great. Telling all my friends to go here. The portions are larger then average and worth exactly what you pay."
ChIJ0W8ERsQ0K4gRNJu8TsZGFxA,4,"Classic Chinese food, everything was really tasty and delicious. Service was good and everything came out promptly. Only reason it is not a 5 star is due to the amount of oil used but overall, a great spot!"
ChIJ0W8ERsQ0K4gRNJu8TsZGFxA,5,Awesome restaurant.. We had a private room for a birthday party and they took great care of us. The food was delicious.
ChIJ0W8ERsQ0K4gRNJu8TsZGFxA,1,The waitress was very rude. My friend didn‚Äôt pay the tip because of her terrible service. And she asked for it. This is Ridiculous.... Food taste good though
ChIJWeGuX8o0K4gR0CrzlkI2Z5c,5,"Fantastic service! Felt well taken care off as I took my friend for a lunch here. The prix fixe menu was varied and a good introduction to the restaurant. Food was flavourful! This is the kind of place where you want to savour your food,sit down and enjoy your meal. It is slightly more expensive as a lunch option but worth a try!"
ChIJWeGuX8o0K4gR0CrzlkI2Z5c,5,"My boss took me out here to eat for Xmas. It was fantastic. The Octopus was amazing, as this meat is very difficult to cook. Staff was fantastic and the restaurant was gorgeous. If you are looking for a nice restaurant downtown for a fancy date / meal come to this place."
ChIJWeGuX8o0K4gR0CrzlkI2Z5c,5,"Attended a work function here for dinner in the downstairs wine cellar. Excellent service, and great food paired with very good Portuguese wines. Would recommend both for group events as well as intimate meals."
ChIJWeGuX8o0K4gR0CrzlkI2Z5c,5,"Probably the best dining experience I had in Toronto. The quality and the freshness of the ingredients make for a dish full of flavors. The service is impeccable, the wine selection is interesting. A delight from the appetizer to the dessert."
ChIJWeGuX8o0K4gR0CrzlkI2Z5c,4,"We went here for a family wedding anniversary. Atmosphere is very inviting and the stuff are excellent! I had the mushroom risotto and it was to die for, absolutely delicious. Everyone was satisfied with their meals and a bonus was that our waiter spoke Portuguese, great for my in-laws who's English is limited!"
ChIJmYnI6tA0K4gRAqUS8Sz4RBc,5,"Kit Kat is a lovely restaurant. It has a unique charm and ambience, and is a wonderful place to spend an elegant evening out. The food itself is spectacular; I really enjoyed the Angel Hair Basilico. Each and every dish looks and tastes as though it was given a huge amount of individual attention. There is not a bad item on the menu. Al is also a treasure, and makes the entire experience exceptional ‚Äì he is a generous man who really made us feel welcome with his quick wit and genuine interest in all his guests. Kit Kat is the finest restaurant in Toronto ‚Äì no question! Can't wait to return again soon."
ChIJmYnI6tA0K4gRAqUS8Sz4RBc,5,"My colleagues and I wanted Italian food while in Toronto for a conference and we found Kit Kat on Google. We didn't realize it was a smaller restaurant, so we were worried they wouldn't have space for our party of 8. When I walked in, the owner saw the look on my face and instantly said ""How many people?"" I told him how many and he nodded and asked us to give him a minute. Before going to find us a table, he asked where we were from. I told him Indiana, then he went off in search of a table. Within minutes he was back and he said ""Indiana! This way!"" Despite the large size of our group and how busy the restaurant was, he found space for us. The rest of our experience was great. Our server, Jamie, was kind and attentive. The food was delicious. And the environment was superb. I particularly loved the tree of heaven and how the owner encouraged me to touch it and make a wish before leaving. Truly a great dining experience and I highly recommend going there!"
ChIJmYnI6tA0K4gRAqUS8Sz4RBc,4,"Had a great pasta dish and seafood special (plus salads and desserts). The staff was welcoming and friendly. The service, however was slow... we waited about 15 minutes to pay the check. Would be happy to return üòä"
ChIJmYnI6tA0K4gRAqUS8Sz4RBc,5,"I went for dinner with my dad and both of our meals were excellent! Best Italian food I have experienced only comparable to the food from an Italian relative. The service is fast and very welcoming. It is a perfect atmosphere for a work lunch, family gathering or a quick bite when spending the day downtown. 10/10 would recommend."
ChIJmYnI6tA0K4gRAqUS8Sz4RBc,5,"John, Al and our server Micheal for making our experience amazing.  Great food and the many servers that checked up on us during our evening really made us feel the exceptional service.  Thank you to all staff that love what they do.  My salmon was cooked to perfection and I can see why this gem has been around for 30 years.  I wish you many more successful years!"
ChIJWYMdhdM0K4gRbMQqRvZfb3c,5,"First stop in Toronto. Easy to find, we walked up and the pub is upstairs.
We missed the lunch rush, so it was quiet and we were seated right away. The pub is clean and while a little dark, it was clean and friendly.
We decided to try the fish and chips. They came out hot and crispy. And so good. The chips were fresh and wonderfully flavored. 
Service was great and nice."
ChIJWYMdhdM0K4gRbMQqRvZfb3c,3,"I was pretty excited to try this on my trip to Canada as the name seemed most definitely Canadian. The staff and service were phenomenal; everyone was eager to take care of us. However, the food was mediocre. I didn't care for the fries, and the burger was a bit too done. My son's fish was a bit rubbery and not very crispy. I was hoping to have found a fantastic place to eat but I suspect it's a better place to drink. The atmosphere was most definitely laid back with a moose head above the bar, cow's butts hanging from the wall, and an array of stereo equipment. The best part for me was that all of the televisions had hockey on, however, it was a Saturday night so I assume any bar in Canada would. Anyway, the overall experience was not terrible but I probably wouldn't come back on my next trip just for the food - I would need to order a few drinks."
ChIJWYMdhdM0K4gRbMQqRvZfb3c,5,"Always a great spot to go if you want a drink before catching a game. It's always been my go to. There's apparently a $100 drink club with a hidden menu which a lot of people are not aware of and they don't advertise it. Be warned it can get rather packed before a Blue Jays, Raptors or leafs game so come early if you want a seat. Also great for large groups. Service is great!"
ChIJWYMdhdM0K4gRbMQqRvZfb3c,4,I really enjoyed the food - the poutine was solid and the club sandwich was just right. Strong beer selection - I would have given five stars if my servers had been more helpful with beer selection. It wasn't that busy and I just got a rehash of the menu when I asked about local beers I was unfamiliar with. Great place to hang out though.
ChIJWYMdhdM0K4gRbMQqRvZfb3c,5,"I‚Äôve come down to The Loose Moose almost every time I‚Äôm visiting downtown Toronto for Events and Concerts! Great menu and one of the best beer lineups in all of the province! Good finger food.l, and burger menu to help you out for either, Lunch and Dinner. I love coming down prior to Concerts. They even played KISS on there Large TVs while KISS was in the city for there End of the Road Tour! Great experience for the whole family! 

100% Recommend!"
ChIJ92TkJNA0K4gRjsJjl0N-1Uo,2,"Appalled by the service that my friends and I received when we went to dine at the restaurant. Food was less than mediocre. We were seated at the very back with no fan or air conditioning on a very hot day, we didn‚Äôt think much of it since our waiter was nice. During dinner the waiter proceeded to tell us that we can access the club using the freight elevator after dinner and would not need to pay cover, all we have to do is inform the elevator operator. The elevator operator took us back to the lobby and insisted we stand in line and pay cover as the elevator entrance to the club was blocked ‚Äúonly for that day‚Äù. I proceeded to inform him that ‚Äúit was unfair‚Äù he shrugged his shoulder and walked away with no care in the world. Luckily the bouncer outside heard me being annoyed and asked what I was angry about? When I told the bouncer about the elevator operator, the bouncer rolled his eyes and allowed us to bypass the line and enter the club. My friends and I didn‚Äôt pay to go to this restaurant to experience racism. None of us will be returning there for food, drinks or to go clubbing."
ChIJ92TkJNA0K4gRjsJjl0N-1Uo,5,"We went when they were having the Summerlicious. It was a very nice experience for all of us (5). Great food, amazing service from the door entry, elevator& to our table service. We will definitely visit again."
ChIJ92TkJNA0K4gRjsJjl0N-1Uo,5,"I attended an even that was hosted here. The attendants were very tidy, friendly, and made sure there weren't any dirty dishes laying out longer than 5 minutes. They were quite on top of things."
ChIJ92TkJNA0K4gRjsJjl0N-1Uo,2,Dessert in the course menu was a joke. Supposed to chef‚Äôs surprise. It was just chocolate sauce in a cup  with 6 pieces of fruits. No effort by the chef for sure. The service was good though.
ChIJ92TkJNA0K4gRjsJjl0N-1Uo,5,"I had my wedding reception here and I cannot thank the staff enough for making it the most amazing day! The service was perfect from the first inquiry we made, right through to the day of the event. The menu was perfect, and they where more then willing to accommodate any changes we requested. It was a perfect day made perfect by the amazing staff at the Fifth and Terrace."
ChIJ6-dbnMw0K4gRPcgnC8nImmg,3,"The food looked like it was cooked some time ago and was kind of cold and dry. The colours of the food just seems outrageously bright. An unnatural colour for cheese. I feel that the quality of the food relative to the price is not quite warranted. However I will say that the service was pleasant and the atmosphere and furnishing is fairly nice. I was so hungry I ate everything before I took a photo, I regret that."
ChIJ6-dbnMw0K4gRPcgnC8nImmg,5,"Great food, environment, service and view of the city was to die for... Desert could have been better!
We got the tasting menu, and it was totally worth it! I asked for the seafood menu (I don't eat meat) and they were able to adjust as needed. Their cocktails were great too! Will come back!"
ChIJ6-dbnMw0K4gRPcgnC8nImmg,4,"Excellent experience here! A friend and I were greeted and seated very quickly. I got the eggs benny and we probably waited only 10-15 minutes.   Friendly and quick service. The prices are decent as well. Overall, really solid breakfast/brunch place. I liked how you could substitute your side for something healthier like seasonal fruits!"
ChIJ6-dbnMw0K4gRPcgnC8nImmg,5,"Great place to have breakfast!! My girlfriend and I recently decided to try it out and was immediately impressed. Great atmosphere and great staff, and on top of that the food was great! Our waitress was really great and we had a amazing time!! Try it out!"
ChIJ6-dbnMw0K4gRPcgnC8nImmg,3,"Eggspectation is an average breakfast restaurant with many options and a great environment. The food was as good as expected. I got the Eggsuberant. Overall it was a decent meal with large proportions. The pancakes were good, the ham was delicious, but the potatoes were a bit bland.

I went when this restaurant was very busy so my wait time to be served as very long as well. Just be prepared for long wait times if you visit at peak times."
ChIJndEqZLU0K4gRR7kPmssVKdk,5,"Above average food and craft beer menu. I enjoyed the spicy pig burger, haddock fish & chips and bacon caramel mini donuts. Each dish was well executed with attention to detail and quality ingredients. Excellent service. The venue was great for watching Raptors playoff game (a few minor audio glitches). Switch to in-house music during commercial breaks was a nice touch."
ChIJndEqZLU0K4gRR7kPmssVKdk,1,"Terrible service if you want something fast. The bartenders are nice but I've come in here 3 times now and it seems as though the more they get busy, the slower it gets. 

Last night I came in for a quick shot, and it took 10 minutes to get someone's attention. Sunday night. The bar was at 30% capacity. 

I hope management can prioritize time as an agenda for bartenders. Your space has the coolest decor and classic music. Maybe a pep talk with the bartenders can help them at least acknowledge someone when they walk in. At least acknowledge that they will be right with me. Instead, they ignore until they have time. 

Probably won't be back."
ChIJndEqZLU0K4gRR7kPmssVKdk,5,"It‚Äôs always a fun time at Dukes. The atmosphere is relaxing. There‚Äôs almost always a great movie on one of the TVs and nostalgic music videos on other TVs. They of course also put the big game on and fans gather to watch. Trivia night is a blast too!
Pub fare is great. I highly recommend the chicken wing and chicken fingers. But pretty
much all the food is great and reasonably priced. Looking for something healthy? I highly suggest the Big Bitchin Salad with avocado! 
Most importantly, the beer selection is vast, and includes local micros and rotating taps."
ChIJndEqZLU0K4gRR7kPmssVKdk,2,"Not what it used to be. Service is...well there is none. Went to grab a few beers and a burger, I got the food menu and waitress never came back but chatted up other staff. Even an empty glass no one came back. She then disappeared and someone else settled the bill with me. Unfortunately that's the last time I'll visit. Dukes was amazing 1-2 years ago, not sure what changed."
ChIJndEqZLU0K4gRR7kPmssVKdk,5,"We stopped for a drink after work.  The beer selection was good, the atmosphere was fun.  My vegetarian friend didn't find much he wanted to eat on their menu, but that's the same as most bars.

Overall a good spot."
ChIJEbBG-dE0K4gRx9dxOlYyldY,5,"I loved it! The pork belly buns were delicious, fried chicken was great, dipping ramen had awesome flavour. Try the chili chicken rice cakes!

The little cooler room where they keep the desserts has a good selection, including their famous compost cookies and crack pie. Remember to refrigerate them when you get home. Can't wait to go again!"
ChIJEbBG-dE0K4gRx9dxOlYyldY,3,"Always love the pork ramen I get here. The pork is soft, the egg is light, and the noodles are springy. Soup base is a little salty/spicier than I would have liked, but it's still good. I got their chicken wings and for $12, it's not very worth it. After my meal, I always go upstairs to their milk bar to buy cookies and truffles üòã"
ChIJEbBG-dE0K4gRx9dxOlYyldY,5,"Went for lunch and was not disappointed. Service is astonishingly quick, courteous and the food comes out with little delay. The menus offer a wide variety of options, all fantastic. Perfect for a quick bite!"
ChIJEbBG-dE0K4gRx9dxOlYyldY,5,"Went to the NYC location years ago and it was fantastic. Gave the Toronto location a try yesterday and was blown away. We got about 6 different items on the menu, and each plate kept getting better and better. Thank you for yet another amazing experience"
ChIJEbBG-dE0K4gRx9dxOlYyldY,1,"I tried here three times, and it used to be pretty good. However, my recent visit was terrible. There was absolutely NO TASTE AT ALL. Can't feel any flavour. It was very disappointing. Service was very bad too. 
If you like Ramen, there are many alternatives in downtown Toronto.."
ChIJF5oEb8I0K4gReAJi5QHFxOA,5,"The food was great and the service was great too. Great selection of pizzas and other options as well. We visited with someone who knows authentic Italian food, and this place was the best she'd tasted outside of Italy! We had a great time celebrating a birthday- it was easy to make reservations online. It was easy to find street parking, even though we parked a block over. Would recommend this place for sure, and will probably revisit."
ChIJF5oEb8I0K4gReAJi5QHFxOA,5,"Amazing!  Very authentic pizza that is hard to find anywhere in North America.  You have to try this place, soooo good.  They have an amazing dessert pizza too.  Warning though, your normal chain pizza will never taste the same now that you will know what real pizza tastes like.  Best pizza I have ever had..."
ChIJF5oEb8I0K4gReAJi5QHFxOA,5,"Ah Via Mercanti where the atmosphere is nice, the wait is expected, the double stacked pizza is delicious! They bring the pizza makers straight from Italy so you can eat a real Italian pizza served the way it should be! Did I mention the wood over?"
ChIJF5oEb8I0K4gReAJi5QHFxOA,5,I saw this place on You Gotta Eat Here on Food Network and everything looked so great. We went there for dinner and the pizza was heavenly. I am definitely going back until I have tried everything on the menu :)
ChIJF5oEb8I0K4gReAJi5QHFxOA,5,Quick lunch. Pizza and salad special. Quenched my craving for the best chewy crust to be found outside Italy
ChIJN1MVTNA0K4gR5xXmB8cv8AI,4,"If you like country... This is your bar. It gets rowdy late night and everyone is drinking and dancing the night away
 They have a bull you can ride- for free! I rode it multiple times as it's quite entertaining. Would have received 5 starts but the Irish guy managing the bull controls had MAJOR attitude."
ChIJN1MVTNA0K4gR5xXmB8cv8AI,5,"This is my favourite place in Toronto. Music is always good, dance floor is always packed and everyone is always having a good time. The only country bar I go to!"
ChIJN1MVTNA0K4gR5xXmB8cv8AI,5,"My friends and I look for affordable fun things and this fit the bill.  Thursdays there was no cover charge and $35 plus tax and tip gave use a great prix fixe meal - free drink to start, pulled-pork stuffed cornbread or other appetizer, great burger or other main course, and a dessert or shot - plus all the entertainment we could want.  Our server was excellent as were all the staff - friendly, attentive, and not rushing us through.  I tried to ride the bull (one ride free) - now I can say I did it - 'nuff said!  We had some line dancing lessons; as well, a good number of the other people there were regulars and really helpful so we didn't feel like idiots.  It would be a great place to go even if someone is on their own, and I really liked the music -- it was also at a level that you could still hear and talk with friends.  Really felt at home and this is a great place for events."
ChIJN1MVTNA0K4gR5xXmB8cv8AI,5,Fun atmosphere. The music is fun and dancing the night away to some country music isnt so bad. They also have a mechanical bull for added entertainment
ChIJN1MVTNA0K4gR5xXmB8cv8AI,5,Great place to go with friends. Tones of menu items and fun friendly staff. Tones of selection in seating. Had a great time the other night with a bunch of friends. Will go back again. Does not disappoint for any time of the day or day of the week.
ChIJyUsC3s80K4gR2Svsdtv57Es,4,"Great place to spend a Friday, Saturday or Friday night. Very busy at the line up so you will have to wait for a bit. Has patio and servers are usually nice. Drinks are good and not too expensive. Food is affordable as long as you don‚Äôt put extra stuff that will make you pay more.The atmosphere is nice but very loud so it might be a challenge for you to hear your friends."
ChIJyUsC3s80K4gR2Svsdtv57Es,4,"Everything was really good from food,  ambience,  price, crowd etc etc.  We (group of 8)  people really enjoyed there. We spend around 2-3 hours it was worth spending the time üòÄ.  The waitress was also good and friendly.  Beers orders were coming quickly but food took time. We ordered nacho that those were good with the beer. Couple of beers and Nacho will cost around 30-40 CAD per person but worth trying the place"
ChIJyUsC3s80K4gR2Svsdtv57Es,5,"Cool place. I'm a tourist from NC. This place reminds me of the places I hung out when I was a poor college student in the 80s. Cheap eats for downtown Toronto and the food was good. Drinks cost more than the food, but in line with Toronto prices. The staff is friendly and attentive even though they were extremely busy."
ChIJyUsC3s80K4gR2Svsdtv57Es,1,"I‚Äôve been to this location once and had an unpleasant experience. Wait times were extremely long which is understandable considering the food is very inexpensive and there aren‚Äôt enough tables. The atmosphere was fairly dark and unhygienic, you basically had to yell to speak to someone to a person sitting at your table. I had to send back my food due to the bun of my burger being cold and when the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù burger was delivered it was just as bad as the first. 

Came back a second time, same experience. Mac and cheese was thoroughly coated in black pepper and processed cheese.
You get what you pay for, definitely twice too many."
ChIJyUsC3s80K4gR2Svsdtv57Es,4,"Every food item is $5.95. Despite that, the portions are good. More than you'd expect for that price. The quality is good too. Much better than what a fast food place would offer for that price. However, there's usually a bit of a wait for the food. Saturday afternoon and it's about 30 minutes. If you want a cheap meal and have some time to relax on their patio it's a good choice.
This place is PACKED on a weekend evening though. Expect a large line to get in. 
Also, the music inside is LOUD. At 2pm on a Saturday you have to nearly shout to talk across a table indoors. Evenings it's worse."
ChIJX7GFAGQtK4gR6r2AAt35J_w,4,"Came for a small birthday gathering. The food is pricey and the place is loud, but the hospitality cannot be beat. The food isn't bad, just very small plates. Lots of variety of tastes and good quality.

When we told them it was a birthday, they came out with a sign and had the whole staff sing. It was very enjoyable and we loved their friendliness. The place is clean and good looking. Seats could be more comfortable, but it works for their style of decor. Would like to come back to try more specials."
ChIJX7GFAGQtK4gR6r2AAt35J_w,5,"We went on a Wednesday evening at 7:00pm. No lines, no waiting, and we got a seat on the patio. The welcome was enthusiastic and the service was very attentive. Even though there were very few people on the patio, the servers came to check on us often to refill our waters and ask how our meal was. 

The price for the dishes are average to what other Izakayas. The taste was fresh and flavorful. 

I highly recommend getting the baked oysters. It's not a whole oyster but oyster pieces baked in cheese and spinach. They take a bit of time so make sure to order it early."
ChIJX7GFAGQtK4gR6r2AAt35J_w,2,"Edit: 4 stars down to 2.

No idea what has happened to this place. The food has become pretty mediocre at best. The staff is unfriendly. The service is pretty bad. 

Tonight there was a hair in my Karaage, they offered nothing. We had to request that it should be removed from out bill. Picture included. 

Great food. Lovely atmosphere. Though the staff and the food is sometimes a crapshoot. We've been there for literally one of the best meals of our lives and we've been there for a really disappointing meal experience. I've posted many great photos. And this place is my go to dinner location. Sometimes when they are very busy they either don't notice you or they deliver food that isn't their best. I'll definitely be back again next week. They are always very polite."
ChIJX7GFAGQtK4gR6r2AAt35J_w,5,It was really busy when we went. But the food is so great. The Japanese tapas were delicious. We got the cheese oysters and the calimari which I would totally recommend. The service was really great and it's worth coming back to
ChIJX7GFAGQtK4gR6r2AAt35J_w,5,"Authentic and hip, this is a restaurant that thrives! Excellent eclectic dishes, versatile  menu, welcoming atmosphere, caring staff who make your experience fun! A fairly spacious patio adds to the slightly quieter pleasure of meeting with company out in the open,  overlooking a quieter street off the busyness of Yonge. Two üëçüëç"
ChIJgZGqX8o0K4gR13cE_3RaqR8,5,"Just had my first experience at the Queen and Beaver and am looking forward to making it my new neighbourhood haunt. Had the mussels, ploughman's board and sticky toffee pudding and a variety of great bar selections. Everything was nostalgic and deeply satisfying. The serving staff (Mark, Ali, Jacob) set a wonderful tone and we‚Äôre great at answering our many questions. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, if you‚Äôre reading this please don‚Äôt take the upstairs leather brown couch because it‚Äôs mine!!"
ChIJgZGqX8o0K4gR13cE_3RaqR8,5,"Oh my god. 

Honestly this is the best pub in the city. This pub is England. Classy dining downstairs and leather chairs and couches upstairs. The burger is steak and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Chips great and the rest of the menu is easily 5 stars I just am addicted to that burger. Classic pints of English bitter on tap with an adventurous IPA or two. The staff seem to love their job and are always more than accommodating. My only complaint is that there isn‚Äôt another one in the west end."
ChIJgZGqX8o0K4gR13cE_3RaqR8,5,"The Queen and Beaver was a gorgeous dining experience in the heart of Toronto. I really enjoyed the food and drinks. The decor is vintage, with lots of little details that make for a very inviting atmosphere overall. It can get pretty loud when it's busy, but you can still have a decent conversation. 

The food is great! It's delicious, authentic, and tastes like a slice of Britain. The beer options are good too, and they have special casked beers for about a dollar more. Overall, definitely one of my top places to eat. 

Fair warning: I would rate this $$$ on a five $ scale from price, but 10/10 for value."
ChIJgZGqX8o0K4gR13cE_3RaqR8,5,"We had such a good time (and good food!) there on Sunday. The pub is very beautiful and the staff is helpful.
I ordered the Sunday Roast, which comes with the prime rib roast, vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, and their wonderful gravy. The beef was very tender and juicy. My boyfriend had the full english breakfast and it was delicious. Their beans had such a good flavor!
To finish our good experience we had their sticky toffee pudding... it is so good! It is not very sweet, it is totally flavorful. The texture of the pudding is to-die-for and the combination with the vanilla ice cream is fantastic.
Overall, everything was very well-seasoned and flavorful, amazing!"
ChIJgZGqX8o0K4gR13cE_3RaqR8,5,"Great ales including Fullers Pride really nice food at sensible prices exceptional friendly accommodating staff (Emma behind the bar****) relaxing atmosphere upstairs bar and terrace in particular. Was only in Toronto for 72 hours only to meet up with an old friend but managed 3 visits,next time will stay longer and visit more. Thank you Q&B it's a great pub more than on par with Surrey UK pubs. Cheers"
ChIJJ9_S_cE0K4gR8QWbmwz5p0E,4,"As a Berliner missing my city's food I was obviously happy to find this place. I think they do a pretty good job with the authentic D√∂ner bun and drinks (Club Mate -must try!) I had the Halloumi and it was good, but not great. The sauces and overall taste are just not the same, but still a nice place to go if you want to get fresh food and a first idea of what D√∂ner is about."
ChIJJ9_S_cE0K4gR8QWbmwz5p0E,5,"Really enjoyed this spot. I had the sandwich with chicken and hot sauce and it was delicious. It was so big that I couldn't finish it. The girl serving us really knew her stuff about the beers on tap, she could describe the summer beer perfectly and it was great. I sat outside and got a great view of Kensington market"
ChIJJ9_S_cE0K4gR8QWbmwz5p0E,5,Prices are fair. Food was delicious and filling! The washrooms have a red button you can press which will turn on disco lights and play music. I ordered the chicken and couscous and the large size is very large. Would recommend trying this place.
ChIJJ9_S_cE0K4gR8QWbmwz5p0E,5,It's a small and cozy place that gets super busy at lunch. I think the lamb is dry but the pork or chicken bowls are great. Nice choice options
ChIJJ9_S_cE0K4gR8QWbmwz5p0E,5,"First time trying d√∂ner. It is amazing! Very tasteful, fresh and compact. I was there during lunch, it was pretty packed. My order was ready within 15 min. Option to take out available. Pick up service is available as well. Make sure you add yogurt herb sauce."
ChIJH9hR9mQtK4gR0a26aNd5jxg,5,"This place is pricey, so be prepared. However, it's very good, and a really good option for a special date night. The pork belly was AMAZING and oh so melt-in-your-mouth decadent. The beef sashimi is also wonderful (very garlicky) and I enjoyed the oysters."
ChIJH9hR9mQtK4gR0a26aNd5jxg,5,Love this place. It's the good one to go chill and enjoy your night with friends. Foods are good too. The burgers are the best as always. It's pretty busy so I recommend to book reso if you come with a group.
ChIJH9hR9mQtK4gR0a26aNd5jxg,4,This is one of my favourite restaurants especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when they have Buck a shuck! Their food has so much flavour and its inexpensive (My favourite dish is the Jumbo shrimp and Lobster sushi). The service is very good and they bring the food right away. The only negative thing that I would have to say is that its really hard to get seats or a table without reservations. But overall the experience is great. I also go to their other location which is closer to where I live at Shops at Don mills
ChIJH9hR9mQtK4gR0a26aNd5jxg,5,"Nice ambience and good service. Ordered a half oz of two flavours of oysters, both were flavourful and fresh. There is also a great select of alcohol."
ChIJH9hR9mQtK4gR0a26aNd5jxg,4,"Their sliders are quite tasty! I recommend it. It's a busy place with good food, chill and pleasant ambience and friendly service. I appreciated the fact that the waiters didn't constantly come to our table to ask how everything was, but came now and then to refill our cups with water (so sensible). Oh,  the items are not inexpensive. So, if you're not down to spend some money, you'll have better luck elsewhere."
ChIJ0T-vYNA0K4gR6sH6RJ00AyE,3,"Come here with hubby because we were craving TACOS. Cute restaurant not many people inside when we go. However, the tacos was expensive around $6-7 each and very very small portions which was disappointing . The portion was so small that it took more time for the food to come to our table then it did for us to finish the 3 tacos... Kinda sad.... Each taco was very flavorful. Would not come back there are many better places"
ChIJ0T-vYNA0K4gR6sH6RJ00AyE,1,"Had dinner yesterday Wed July 10, 2019 and was disappointed.  The price of the food was not worth the portions they serve you.  Was not informed when asking for more tortillas chips there would be another charge, so waiter brought more tortilla chips but not more guacamole but our bill showed the full price for a second serving.  This was my first Mexican food experience ever and not sure if I would come back.  I wanted to have dinner in a more traditional Mexican restaurant not one of these ‚ÄúPosh‚Äù places where the food looks good but should also taste good and have a little more portions."
ChIJ0T-vYNA0K4gR6sH6RJ00AyE,4,"$ - Great place with some great food. I would say they are up there for best Tacos in Toronto! They always have good music playing and the servers always have something good to recommend!

I always start with the Queso Dip and switch it up on what tacos I get and I've never been disappointed!

Nice place, great vibe, cold drinks, bomb tacos. I would recommend it to anyone and will be back soon!"
ChIJ0T-vYNA0K4gR6sH6RJ00AyE,4,"Got the chicken and steak tacos, were quite tasty and flavorsome, can be a little messy to eat but comes with the territory. Chicken wings were delicious and were the best part of my meal, my only gripe was they were the starter but cost just as much as my 3 main tacos combined. 16 cad for a starter, probably best to re-evaluate that."
ChIJ0T-vYNA0K4gR6sH6RJ00AyE,4,"Tacos! They were good. Is there a hostel upstairs or something? Several people wandered through with backpacks. I found that odd, though I can't say it really interfered with my meal. The place was pretty busy. Each taco is pretty expensive (for a taco), but they're certainly good."
ChIJ13xO78EzK4gRdwEiU8N4oCk,4,"This is an upscale, fun spot to grab drinks and bites with friends. There is a large patio with ample seating and couches, and the ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxing as well. Food is definitely on the pricier end in keeping with the restaurant's upscale theme, and there is a wide selection of seafood and appetizers to choose from. Service was quick and very friendly, and the staff are happy to suggest pairings for your drinks and meals. The oysters and lobster are a must - they're prepared fresh and come with a good variety of toppings. Definitely worth checking this spot out if you're in the downtown core!"
ChIJ13xO78EzK4gRdwEiU8N4oCk,5,"I have been here twice, both times were for dinner. It is one of my top three fine dining choices in Toronto. The staff are all amazing. 

I had dinner with a couple of family members the other night. At first we were seated at a table right across from the kitchen. It was a bit loud. At the same time the restaurant was packed and I was not sure if they could move us. One of the managers, Ester, was absolutely amazing in finding us a cozy corner table and made the world of difference in our experience. She checked on us a few minutes after we moved to our new table. Our server, Maven (I hope I remember her name right) was absolutely phenomenal. The other staff were also fantastic. The food was delicious (I must say I liked the dishes I from my previous visit more). All in all, the service and courtesy they provide at the Chase is exemplary.

Thank you to Ester, Maven and the other staff whom I did not get a chance to ask their name."
ChIJ13xO78EzK4gRdwEiU8N4oCk,5,"Great place for a fine dinner, oysters and wine. If you‚Äôre a beer or whiskey person, this is not your best bet. The place has a cool rooftop as well with enough space in the ground floor to host private events too. The oysters were very fresh and the tuna ceviche added that extra zing next to it. All in all, a recommended spot for both a date and a semi formal outings."
ChIJ13xO78EzK4gRdwEiU8N4oCk,5,"Great fresh oysters, lobster roll, clam chowder soup, and fish and chips. Prices are high but not bad considering the food you get. Our waitress spoke insanely fast as if she was trying to get us out as quickly as possible."
ChIJ13xO78EzK4gRdwEiU8N4oCk,4,"The Chase is a nice beach-side style restaurant in the heart of downtown Toronto. The decor reminded me of sea side brunch restaurants in Miami. Ultimately, this is offset by the heavy corporate vibe that emanates from every corner. Not surprised as clearly this restaurant is well situated in the financial district.

The service was okay, if a bit abrupt. Not overly friendly, or professional as they were just hanging around in a corner when it wasn't so busy. When it was finally time for our waiter to take our order, the responses were short and abrupt. Not very welcoming. Our waiter even forgot our appetizer.

The food was very good. Albeit, a bit overpriced, but that's the premium you pay for dining where you dine. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the clientele pay via company credit card as opposed to personal funds, which is what allows them to charge more. Oysters were fresh and delicious, and the cashew goat cheese is a must have for any and all cheese lovers.

Overall, the pricing and the service is what brought this place down from a five star. If service was outstanding, I wouldn't mind making this a five star, as the food quality can justify and support the pricing."
ChIJH5MAJbI0K4gRSsoNgy5HN0Q,3,I love Sansotei ramen however this location is unfortunately lacking good service and the weirdest thing is they didn't have a take out container for soup. Really? In a ramen restaurant? Other locations are great tho.
ChIJH5MAJbI0K4gRSsoNgy5HN0Q,5,"Great ramen, reasonable price, very fast service and polite staff. There's a lineup at almost all times but it's moving very fast."
ChIJH5MAJbI0K4gRSsoNgy5HN0Q,4,"Finally try them is great pork is awesome. Soup is good. Thin and thick noodles. I like thick better. Size of noodles is ok, price is fair"
ChIJH5MAJbI0K4gRSsoNgy5HN0Q,5,Great Ramen! 5 different options of flavors for the pork base. We had Tonkatsu Black and Shoyu and loved both
ChIJH5MAJbI0K4gRSsoNgy5HN0Q,4,"Great customer service, okay price relative to food quality."
ChIJby5Olso0K4gRE0K3jaB9cCc,5,Very affordable and yummy! They have combos available which save you money.  The patties are very crispy and are made fresh. They have a good variety of drinks as well. I love the spicy patties here. The cashier is always nice too.
ChIJby5Olso0K4gRE0K3jaB9cCc,4,Fast and friendly service. Good price for what you get. The vegetarian patty was fairly good but the coco bread a bit chewier than expected. A combo of 2 patties + drink is about $4 and good if you're on the go as there is also not really anywhere to sit.
ChIJby5Olso0K4gRE0K3jaB9cCc,3,"A pretty solid option for reasonably priced patties if you're in the area. 

I came here around 5pm on a Thursday evening and unfortunately they were out of vegetarian patties. I did get a chance to try the Chicken Patty & Beef Patties though. Both were really tasty, but I think I liked the Beef one a little more. 

I'll probably be back again if I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite while in the downtown core."
ChIJby5Olso0K4gRE0K3jaB9cCc,5,"I ‚ù§ Patties Express, anyone who likes patties should come here to like them even more and anyone who doesn't like patties should come here to convert to liking patties"
ChIJby5Olso0K4gRE0K3jaB9cCc,1,"Had patties from this place twice and both times I had a terrible stomachache.  Three of us ordered the spicy beef patties and all three had stomachache for days.  Weirdly enough, the person who ate the extra spicy patty was fine.

Yesterday I went back to give it another shot and contracted food poisoning (E coli).  Again, I had the spicy beef patty.  Avoid at all costs!"
ChIJE8Gy-C3L1IkRBLNumcFv_kE,5,Went here on Saturday night with a group to celebrate a birthday. Our waiter was very nice and the service was great. Food tasted great too!
ChIJE8Gy-C3L1IkRBLNumcFv_kE,5,"Fantastically prepared food. Went for oysters, but stayed for the great dishes and solid service. Will be back to enjoy the rest of the menu."
ChIJE8Gy-C3L1IkRBLNumcFv_kE,5,Great drinks and wonderful food. I loved everything I ate there. Definitely would go again!
ChIJE8Gy-C3L1IkRBLNumcFv_kE,4,"The e36 burger and buck a shuck oysters were amazing. The fried chicken was all but delectable. Drinks were decent although we only grabbed the happy hour options which had the same creativity as ketchup on fries. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs a great place to go without the fuss of waiting for a table."
ChIJE8Gy-C3L1IkRBLNumcFv_kE,3,"I sincerely appreciated the modern and sophisticated interior design and vibe. I was able to enjoy spending time talking with my friend while munching on fried chicken (perfectly sized) and sipping on the cucumber cosmo (surprisingly good). I was satisfied with my visit. The waiters were attentive, hospitable and engaging. I would definitely revisit! 
Oh, I didn't have a problem with this at all, but if you're a huge fan of oysters, be warned: they cap you at 12/person (hahaha)"
ChIJYbN6JbI0K4gRMOCsOpUyfsY,5,"Second time here, loved it as much or even more than the first time. The tapas are delicious, sake was amazing too. This is a great place for two people or a small group to get together and enjoy Japanese dishes and drinks. Marinated torched mackerel and beef carpaccio are two must haves with sake."
ChIJYbN6JbI0K4gRMOCsOpUyfsY,5,"One of my favorites places to go! Great casual Japanese place serving comfort food, beer and sake. Their cocktails taste great. The staff are very friendly and polite.  Ordered the spicy fries and chicken karage which tasted amazing."
ChIJYbN6JbI0K4gRMOCsOpUyfsY,5,"Chilled atmosphere, i've been there quite a few times now. Consistantly decent service, decent food and reasonably priced drinks. 
It's japanese food and the staff and customer base are primarily japanese as
 well. I will be going again. 
(Not sure if the front cover of the menu still has the hand drawn picture. Check it out if you go there. Moderately amusing)."
ChIJYbN6JbI0K4gRMOCsOpUyfsY,5,I went for dinner with a friend and ordered a stir fry noodles with cabbage and pork. The menu items were reasonably priced and the portion is good for about 13 dollars. The dish was delicious and filling. Next time would recommend ordering many dishes to share among many as opposed to one dish per person
ChIJYbN6JbI0K4gRMOCsOpUyfsY,4,A quiet place for some tasty Japanese tapas. Will return.
ChIJCcJAI800K4gRZW4vIEUZH7k,5,"Love love love this place. It made me happy. Great food and drinks. Cool atmosphere. Great staff. Just a wonderful little local place. If I lived in the area, I would make it a regular. Had the chicken pot pie and it was delicious...probably best I've ever had. Had the Angry Goat beer and was really nice. Would definitely go back. So glad I came across this place. Now I want to try everything on the menu."
ChIJCcJAI800K4gRZW4vIEUZH7k,4,Food was good and came very quickly. Both the falafal sandwich and the club were very saucy. Almost too loud to comfortably talk during the height of lunch hour.
ChIJCcJAI800K4gRZW4vIEUZH7k,2,"We went to The Gabardine the other week and went specifically for the mac n' cheese. Unfortunately it was just okay (it was really cheesy so I will give it that, however the winner by far so far in downtown is the mac n cheese at The Federal), the flat iron steak was really bad - just avoid it, the fries were good, and the toffee/date cake with vanilla ice cream was good. So I would give it a 3/5. The service was not all that great either.....and very close seating between the tables. Overall a 2/5. Would not return"
ChIJCcJAI800K4gRZW4vIEUZH7k,5,"Good atmosphere with dim lighting. From the outside you may mistake it to a five star restaurant but wait until you see the menu. The menu offers most of the dishes below 20 dollars and they taste great. To sum up, five star atmosphere with a very friendly price considering it‚Äôs location in downtown Toronto."
ChIJCcJAI800K4gRZW4vIEUZH7k,5,Cozy little joint. Serving a higher level pub fare. Delicious fish pot pie!  Comfortable atmosphere and excellent service.
ChIJy70XqzTL1IkRbBYx7hAS3ZI,5,"I don't get out much, so it's nice to get out where I don't need to be in the kitchen . This was an excellent burger, tasty and very moist. Cooked to Medium and definitely worth it. My wife had the pizza, sauce had an amazing hint of lemon. Good meal. Understanding that this is an Italian based restaurant... I was disappointed in the whisky selection. But it's sort of to be expected."
ChIJy70XqzTL1IkRbBYx7hAS3ZI,4,Food was warm and yummy and they were nice about small modifications. Servers were super friendly too. Overall atmosphere was cute as well.
ChIJy70XqzTL1IkRbBYx7hAS3ZI,2,"While this was overall one of my favourite places to dine, my last experience with a waitress (her name is Ariana) on June 12, 2019 was a disaster. She asked if we had any ""food allergies."" We said No and, after inquiring with her whether it was a vegetarian meal, ordered a soup among other meals. Its base contained pork pieces, which we do not consume anyway. I asked her to remove the food as it was not what we asked for. She responded by saying that she had asked if we had any ""dietary restrictions."" That she never asked us. She removed the food with an attitude and also told us that the order would be canceled and not charged to us. To not spoil the dinner in the presence of our guest, I did not respond to her attitude and did not say a word about the difference between food allergies and dietary restirctions. When I received the bill, the soup was included in our bill and I paid for it. I am sorry but the Trattoria is no more one of my favourites anymore. I feel that I was cheated and mistreated."
ChIJy70XqzTL1IkRbBYx7hAS3ZI,5,"The food is super, it was a great experience dining here. Their lemon olive cake is brilliant! Highly recommend! Aidan was very nice."
ChIJy70XqzTL1IkRbBYx7hAS3ZI,5,"If you are served by a waiter named Will, you'll receive the best service you've had in a long time. I was so pleasantly surprised last night by this place. The food is good, but Will made our experience great. He was super friendly, engaging, and just made us feel very welcome. Thanks, Will. üòäüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ChIJQxrxcLQ0K4gRxrIvV6TU22Y,1,"Was so excited to try the food here, but when I placed an order for  two burritos and only one was in the bag, my excitement vanished pretty quickly. It's not like we had an outlandish order, two basic burritos. Not entirely sure how you mistake the number two for the number one, but apparently it is possible. I'm sure the food is still good, but I wouldn't know since I paid for an invisible burrito. Check your bag before you leave the store/after you receive your delivery."
ChIJQxrxcLQ0K4gRxrIvV6TU22Y,3,Honestly I don't know what is happening with this place is like the staff that is working here doesn't care about the customer because I order a bowl mix not spicy and I get it spicy and also wait like 30 minutes to get the order please pay attention to what are you doing and do the stuff well
ChIJQxrxcLQ0K4gRxrIvV6TU22Y,5,Best in the city!  A place where they make it like they are for themselves.  Recommend the Steak & Chicken Burrito but the Bowls are amazing too!  You'll never go anywhere else once you go here.
ChIJQxrxcLQ0K4gRxrIvV6TU22Y,4,"Picked up food for my boss, I think they liked it"
ChIJQxrxcLQ0K4gRxrIvV6TU22Y,5,"May 4, 2019 - 2250 hours 
‚Ä¢ Awesome portion for a large steak burrito
‚Ä¢ Ingredients were flavourful and seasoned well
‚Ä¢ Service was quick and courteous"
ChIJtY7dIMs0K4gREEfQx6rkc-A,5,I love Joey! Food is always good I had the  California Chicken sandwich. We walked in and was seated right away. Visited late on a Monday to our surprise there was a late night menu so we saved $5 on each meal. Staff was pleasant held great conversation.  Restroom was clean and stocked.
ChIJtY7dIMs0K4gREEfQx6rkc-A,5,"Amazing service! Girlfriend and I came in late night just looking for some apps and drinks and then decided we wanted our own meals. Both our meals were amazing we were absolutely mind blown at the taste and presentation. Not only that, but the service was spectacular they were on top of drink refills for all patrons and working smoothly and efficiently. I highly recommended to anyone looking for a nice night out."
ChIJtY7dIMs0K4gREEfQx6rkc-A,5,"This was our first visit to this location, and the service was excellent.

Our server, Abby, was particularly kind. When she realized my wife was pregnant, she brought over a virgin cocktail on the house, so she could feel like she was ""having a drink with dinner"". Even though we didn't order anything. 

This kind of service is rare these days, will definitely be returning!"
ChIJtY7dIMs0K4gREEfQx6rkc-A,5,"My favourite place in the city for delicious drinks and amazing food. Their veggie burger is THE BEST veggie burger I have ever had. The place is always busy and located in a very convenient spot downtown.
While we had a long wait as it was a Friday night, the staff took orders for drinks in the waiting area, which was great. They also passed around appetizers which was amazing!
Once seated, our waiter Jacob was so nice and patient. He answered all our questions and was super nice!
Food here never disappoints. We ordered a couple for appetizers, which were great. The Tandoori chicken flatbread is my favourite. They also allow you to substitute the meat for a vegetarian option, which is amazing!
All our mains were perfect and delicious. Our wine was also quite tasty and refreshing. Absolutely love the place, service and food and will continue to go there."
ChIJtY7dIMs0K4gREEfQx6rkc-A,5,"I love Joeys. I go there all the time, like all the time. Service, food and atmosphere is fantastic. I go there about 2 times a week, and servers are always professional. Since I've been going there for so long and often, there have been minimal instances where mistakes have been made. However when mistakes were made, servers and managers have been quick to correct them. Also, you can't go wrong with their happy hour menu!"
ChIJ9y-dotI0K4gR8C-CfDq_pm8,3,"Great spot downtown for drinks and food. Its proximity to the Financial District and large patio is always a large draw after 5PM, and reservations are recommended in advance. Service is good and relatively quick, and the staff here are really friendly and happy to provide recommendations on your orders. Definitely worth visiting if you work or spend time downtown!"
ChIJ9y-dotI0K4gR8C-CfDq_pm8,3,"Taylor is the best server here!  If the rest if the staff worked as hard as her it would be amazing, I hope they don‚Äôt pool tips!  We ate chicken app and the pizza was amazing.  

When they closed downstairs Taylor upstairs at the bar was prompt, quick, and knew what she was doing! She is the best server upstairs, period!

Good view of many TVs to see any game.

Wow! I must ad, that when we were addressed by the manager, he asked us to leave! Are you kidding me??? We brought up bad service to you and we are the problem?  Seeing as one of our party had worked in the industry we were trying to help you, will not return."
ChIJ9y-dotI0K4gR8C-CfDq_pm8,5,"Before coming here I had the misconception that this was a pizza joint or sports bar. I was pleasantly surprised. At lunchtime things were hopping but the staff seemed totally on top of the process. Service was fast and efficient. Food is very good, with a creative and varied menu. I had a tuna poke bowl which was excellent."
ChIJ9y-dotI0K4gR8C-CfDq_pm8,4,"Considering this place is in the heart of the financial district, surrounded with buildings on all sides, it still has an open and airy feel on the patio. If you're heading there for lunch or happy hour drinks, I recommend heading out early to find a place on the patio.

Friendly staff and chill vibe. The food was delicious but I wasn't stoked about how long we waited for our meals to come out (people who came after us were getting their meals and leaving before we did). Despite that, I think I'd revisit. 

Highly recommend their Bang Bang Shrimp. And their chicken sandwich made good leftovers too!"
ChIJ9y-dotI0K4gR8C-CfDq_pm8,5,"First time coming here, it was great. The service is friendly and welcoming. The beer is great. And the food is delicious. We got fish tacos and chicken tacos. Both enjoyed our meal. Reasonable price for the food, service and atmosphere you get. A new favourite."
ChIJCf3Ifdo0K4gR7Oza09kkCnI,5,"Been here a million times and its consistently excellent. From the food, the staff, ambiance and energy - this place is great. The staff is very genuine, attentive and caring which makes for a great / chill vibe. The patio in the back is also awesome! Go here and get the lamb curry wrap. You're welcome."
ChIJCf3Ifdo0K4gR7Oza09kkCnI,5,Decided to try this place from a friend's recommendation. The soups all got a little kick to it but not a bad thing! The heat helps especially if you're feeling under the weather or have a sore throat. The staff there are friendly and offer suggestions depending on your mood. The soup and wrap combos also offer a smaller bowl of soup - but super filling!
ChIJCf3Ifdo0K4gR7Oza09kkCnI,5,"RaviSoups has a very small but delicious menu! I‚Äôm so happy that there are dishes without dairy ingredients, because I‚Äôm lactose intolerant. The wrap I got was very filling and delicious! The atmosphere is very nature inspired because of the big wood table in the centre of the restaurant. There was free flavoured water too. The staff were super nice!"
ChIJCf3Ifdo0K4gR7Oza09kkCnI,4,I absolutely loved their lamb wrap but was not impressed by their chicken warp. The latter lacked as much flavor and the former had just set the standards very high for me. Portions are good. I would definitely visit this place again.
ChIJCf3Ifdo0K4gR7Oza09kkCnI,5,Great customer service. They forgot to make my order while I used the washroom but made up for it with a quick sorry and making the food. To top it off they gave me a free drink.
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRBywc1ZieRe8,4,"Have not been to Burrito Boyz in a long long time. Boy have things changed. The menu is so expansive it could not figure out what I wanted. So much variety, the is something for everyone. Felt a bit lost in the ordering/pickup process but somehow it really works itself out and que efficient at it. Order in a place off chaos. 
Food, was the typical burrito. Weighs a tonne even when you order a small. More than plenty. I had the halibut and it was great. A lighter meat than the typical beef and chicken. Had all the fixings and that's how you should try it. I really enjoyed it. For someone who does not know when to stop eating you end up hoovering it. Will reserve a bit more room in my rating after I try other things obj the menu. It's a high 4 stars."
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRBywc1ZieRe8,5,"One of my fave lunch spots near the financial centre. I like to get a fish/shrimp mix. Really tasty.

They grill each burrito for a long time, which makes it really nice. It also means that the line can back up a bit during the lunch rush. You order, then you wait near the counter for them to call your number to choose your toppings, and then you wait for them to call your number over the PA system when it has finished grilling. You need to be on your toes."
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRBywc1ZieRe8,5,"I had a delicious quesadilla, customized the way I like. Everything tasted fresh and well cooked.

Staff were friendly and helped me order since it was my first visit. Definitely will return next time I'm in town."
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRBywc1ZieRe8,4,Good burrito. It's a takeaway type place with minimal seating. Had small chicken and small steak (split with a friend) and it was quite filling.  Recommend extra napkins as it gets messy. The burrito is made to order and they don't skimp on toppings.
ChIJLbNPx9E0K4gRBywc1ZieRe8,5,Awesome Mexican food. No wonder it has good reviews. But really really crowded place. Need to order and wait for your number to tell what you want in your bowl and then wait to get it. But worth the wait. Taste is good. We went for lunch on Friday so crowded. It also has small seating area. But no table service.
ChIJkdpPScI0K4gRrSJtJ9uIT74,1,"I bought the oxtail plate, the jerk pork plate, and the linguini with shrimp curry. 

Oxtail: I got not one piece of oxtail in my dish, it was only beef neck bones with no meat. When you're paying $16 for a meal you expect some meat. Absolutely ridiculous. 

Jerk Pork: this was an all right dish nothing compared to the hype this place gets. The pork flavours were alright but it was dry except for the fatty parts. The rice too was dry and the gravy they threw on top of like a bottled glaze sauce you could buy at no frills. 

Shrimp Linguine: This was the best dish we had, and really there was nothing Jamaican about it. It was tasty, the noodles were fresh, and the lady was preparing it right on the spot so it was hot and fresh. When I got home however the whole thing was leaked out into the bag because she had not closed the container properly so I legitimately was scooping the sauce from inside the bag. 

Overall this place definitely does not live up to the hype and is nothing to write home about. There are delicious Jamaican places downtown to try out and this is definitely not one of them."
ChIJkdpPScI0K4gRrSJtJ9uIT74,5,"Excellent food. I had the Jerk chicken which was juicy and spicy üî•üî• with the coleslaw. My brother had the goat curry, again with fall-of-the-bone mutton. Huge portions (you probably don't need a Large). All for a good price. Highly worth it. 
PS: Seating is limited though, take-out would be more practical."
ChIJkdpPScI0K4gRrSJtJ9uIT74,4,"Tried the jerk chicken recommended by a friend and it was flavorful and deliciou. Had it with beans and rice and a side of coleslaw.  The portion was generous (three pieces of chicken in a medium) and I managed to finish every bit of it. 

It would be nice if they asked if those who ate in if they would prefer paper plates instead, and nixed the plastic container for the side. I can see why they opted for convenience, as the lineup eventually stretched out the door."
ChIJkdpPScI0K4gRrSJtJ9uIT74,3,"There‚Äôs two doors to this place, one where you can get Jamaican dishes and another for Jamaican Italian fusion dishes. So choose as you wish. We didn‚Äôt know so ended up in the Jamaican one. The food was great and inexpensive. The lady was friendly and helped us select our plates. There‚Äôs a variety of soft drinks from Jamaica, so it made the Jamaican experience complete. The place can definitely be cleaner, and it‚Äôd be nice to have hand sanitizer or a sink with soap and water to wash our hands after eating especially if you‚Äôre eating or cutting the meat with your hands."
ChIJkdpPScI0K4gRrSJtJ9uIT74,5,"I have eaten here at least 4 times and this was my experience today:

Taste: 10/10
Service:10/10. I waited no more than 5 mins and my food was delivered with a smile 
cost: 10/10. A better value than  most places that I've visited

Conclusion: Very Highly recommended"
ChIJna5xqdE0K4gRY2U5hw6ZXYI,5,The restaurant is very much popular. They offer a good varieties of exquisite Mediterranean dishes. I've tried this food more than twice. The food is always delicious. They always provide the best service. The pricing is affordable too.
ChIJna5xqdE0K4gRY2U5hw6ZXYI,4,"There good is great. The menu is deep. Reserve for a table, the place is usually always full. The cocktails are amazing. Taking a star off for the pricing. Will visit again."
ChIJna5xqdE0K4gRY2U5hw6ZXYI,4,"Food is really good and looks gorgeous when served. Something different to what we used to eat, unique flavours. Definitely worth trying. The only thing that one of the survants was kinda irritated.. we asked him questions regarding the food, for example what is good to try, because it was our first time there, and apparently he didn‚Äôt like our questions.. he showed us some attitudes. We could really understand why he acted in the way he did, so our experience in this place was not fully enjoyable. But other team members were very nice, and girls were explaining what comes in our plates. The dessert was fantastic."
ChIJna5xqdE0K4gRY2U5hw6ZXYI,5,"Amazing food and really great service. Both eggplant dishes were great and the rice with lentils was awesome! And so was the desert, baklava shell with mint ice cream and chocolate mousse"
ChIJna5xqdE0K4gRY2U5hw6ZXYI,5,We were a group of 7 and our server made excellent suggestions for a sharing selection of appetizers and entrees. Food was delicious and service fantastic. Would highly recommend.
ChIJZePc1dE0K4gRi8S3_mM64mo,4,"Had the fixed price menu for $77 each. For the price, the food was decent, but the portion was a bit smaller then I thought for a 5 course meal. The servers explained each sashimi and dish which was a great experience. The fish was definitely fresh! Great service, but a bit overpriced."
ChIJZePc1dE0K4gRi8S3_mM64mo,5,The finest sushi you can get in Toronto. Daily menu changes with what is available on the day. Attendants are incredibly helpful and responsive. Highly recommend the otoro and torches sushi. Seating is Very limited
ChIJZePc1dE0K4gRi8S3_mM64mo,4,"Nice concept. You can directly order on iPads and let the waiter take your order. The food come fast and they know exactly what you‚Äôve order. Easy fast and good food. The price is quite reasonable around 30$ but check their website, sometimes they charge you 2-3$ if it‚Äôs an holiday"
ChIJZePc1dE0K4gRi8S3_mM64mo,5,Some of the best sushi I‚Äôve ever had. I love that the chefs prepare and season each piece of sushi so no extra soy sauce or wasabi is needed. Service is top notch. Wine/sake was very pricey but hey the whole experience was great. Can‚Äôt wait to come back.
ChIJZePc1dE0K4gRi8S3_mM64mo,1,"Shameful sushi with disappointing service. 
Don‚Äôt waste money on this place. If you‚Äôve been to many other luxury sushi restaurants, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. Pressed sushi wasn‚Äôt pressed properly and fish wasn‚Äôt evenly topped or filled in sushi. What a poor job for high-end restaurant. They said sushi already had flavour so I shouldn‚Äôt need soy sauce but it actually lacked of flavour. Customer service was horrible. All the servers were just passing by but they didn‚Äôt realize we wanted to order. We waited for a long time. Then the server didn‚Äôt even have eye contact while taking order. ‚ÄúOk‚Äù was her response after our order. 
Now, you might want to consider a different sushi restaurant. Don‚Äôt ruin your experience."
ChIJpy8FA8I0K4gRrnthsBbx544,3,"Decent burger but nothing to write home about. Found the choice of bun strange and the meat fairly bland. The bun lacked flavor. Very soft and added very little. I got a double stacked 4oz burger. Perhaps the 6oz are more juicy and flavorful.

The onion rings were really boring. Same onion rings you'd get anywhere. Best onion rings still belong to Fresh and The Works as a far second. The server wasn't especially friendly or polite. Didn't recommend much, I asked what the favorites are and she made little recommendation. 

Maybe worth a visit. Price was good though! Burger was a 3/5"
ChIJpy8FA8I0K4gRrnthsBbx544,5,An amazing place. Been there last month.The atmosphere was nice. The burger was delicious & juicy. The staff was helpful. Enjoyed my time being there.
ChIJpy8FA8I0K4gRrnthsBbx544,5,"The food was yummy.
Good service, friendly staff, nice atmosphere, clean washrooms.
They offer halal cuisine which is great.
I ordered the ""B seven"" and rocket fries. It's not as spicy as I hoped but nothing really is spicy to me anymore so.."
ChIJpy8FA8I0K4gRrnthsBbx544,5,"This place is a must-visit for any self-respecting burger fan! We went for my son's 8th birthday (all the way from Manchester!) and had everything from double burgers to vegan burgers - all were absolutely delicious. Also all the staff are just lovely, so friendly and made my son's time there really special - even gave him a birthday milkshake. Awesome food, awesome service, awesome place, wish we lived closer! üòç"
ChIJpy8FA8I0K4gRrnthsBbx544,5,I went to the place for burgers with a couple friends since one friend insisted that the place was one of the most important burger joints of Toronto. I was excited to see what they had to offer and I was not disappointed. Each of us ordered something different and each of our burgers looked so good they looked like they were straight out of a food magazine. Mine was delicious af and the burger was perfect for the hunger rush that I had been feeling after exploring Chinatown. The place had a nice vibe and chill employees. The bathrooms were kinda dirty and dark but definitely do not let that stop you from going because this burger place is a must go.
ChIJJZP2IzPL1IkRoIXM5dEE9ck,2,"Initially I was impressed with the place, nice atmosphere, good seating, food was great. Loved the hostess. She was so sweet. The main course and drink came. Meal was delicious. That's when things went down hill. I asked for a menu to get dessert. No one came back for 30 minutes. Finally I just asked for the check. So I could leave. That's why my rating dropped from 5 to 2. Sometimes simple things are the most important."
ChIJJZP2IzPL1IkRoIXM5dEE9ck,5,"Fantastic restaurant when you're looking for a nicer meal and are OK with spending a few extra dollars. The staff is attentive, the wine list is great and they gave daily specials. I loved the way they prepared my beef and veggies. 

I definitely recommend making reservations and heading over earlier to make sure you can get in."
ChIJJZP2IzPL1IkRoIXM5dEE9ck,5,Came again for my wife birthday. Never a disappointment with tasting menu. Tasting menu they gave us a 8 weeks dry aged steak and it was something amazing. Dessert was also a surprise for this time.
ChIJJZP2IzPL1IkRoIXM5dEE9ck,5,Thank you Andrew and Sara for making our experience so amazing! Came here with my family to celebrate and our servers went above and beyond! Loved the vegan option as well. Highly recommend!
ChIJJZP2IzPL1IkRoIXM5dEE9ck,4,"Nice, cozy and modern restaurant, was searching for a place for birthday celebration and got to know this restaurant. Heard the dishes are creative and tasty so gave it a try.

Ordered fresh raw oysters as starter, and lobster spaghetti, roasted black cod as mains.  Oysters were fresh and saucy, paired with special sauces they provided and it really intrigued my appetise. For mains, they both were creamy with sauces at the bottom, broth was Tom yum for the cod and it's a bit too salty; cod was rightfully roasted in time making it soft and warm inside while maintaining crispiness outside. Unfortunately the dish only had cod and small portion of radish noodle and veggies. For me portion was too small for a main dish. Spaghetti was also done well, but lobster meats were again small portion.

Service was on point, although the waiter did not come often to us.

Not bad for a try, but for me I would probably not go again as their portions are too small and a bit too salty."
ChIJE65wodI0K4gRGHR5w5d4YPI,5,"After seeing our play we were meandering back to the international continental and happened in here. Boy am I glad we did. Our server, Selena was delightful and very efficient and hard-working. The food was excellent and prepared and brought us in a timely fashion. I can highly recommend this restaurant particularly if you‚Äôre fortunate to have Selena is your server. The only thing I would change would be how loud the music was"
ChIJE65wodI0K4gRGHR5w5d4YPI,4,"Great spot for dinner in the Financial District. The menu is extensive without being overbearing, and there are a wide variety of dishes for all kinds of tastes. Service is timely and very friendly, and the staff are always happy to give suggestions or modifications to your meal. The restaurant also has multiple patios, and is a favourite for those who work nearby. Check it out when you're in the area!"
ChIJE65wodI0K4gRGHR5w5d4YPI,5,"Had a business lunch here and I loved everything about the Cactus Club. When my colleague and I arrived here, we were greeted by the hostess and a waitress brought us up to the deck area where they reserved our table. It was cold the day we went and thank God they had heaters everywhere on the deck to keep us warm. Not to mention, the natural lighting that comes through the ceiling gave an overall cool and happy vibe. I ordered some truffle fries and the butternut shrimp ravioli (around $30) and would pay another visit just to eat these two dishes again. Our waitress was also very nice, she kept coming back to fill our cups with water even when it was rush hour lunch time. I‚Äôll be back!!!"
ChIJE65wodI0K4gRGHR5w5d4YPI,5,"Bring from British Columbia, cactus club cafe has to be my favourite. It‚Äôs given since it‚Äôs a BC family owned restaurant. 
I‚Äôd chose cactus club over any other restaurant any day. Even though I‚Äôve been there thousands of time.
I love everything about them, their food, drinks and the ambiance. 
They have super friendly staff. This particular location has three floors. Their rooftop is amazing, it‚Äôs like bar up there. Great music and great people. 
Do visit if your in downtown. It‚Äôs 5 min walk from Nathan Philip centre"
ChIJE65wodI0K4gRGHR5w5d4YPI,5,"The restaurant is gorgeous and upscale in the financial district of Toronto. The food was incredible and the service matched. There were plenty of options for all dietary restrictions including vegan and vegetarian. I was so pleased with my experience there, it was a perfect place to bring my mother for her birthday. I would suggest dressing up a little as most people are coming in business attire from work. And I would also suggest making a reservation because they‚Äôre often at capacity for reserved tables. The food is good value for money and they give a reusable bag and cardboard takeaway container for take away."
ChIJTyCaZ7Q0K4gRdLuUpx8kmJk,4,I have friends that love this place. I generally prefer a more traditional dining experience because they don't usually offer plates or cutlery. In stead you eat with gloved hands and everything comes in bags. Service is good the price is reasonable and the food is delicious and served in large quantities.
ChIJTyCaZ7Q0K4gRdLuUpx8kmJk,5,"Great food! A bit slow at first, but later our new server Amber was incredible and food as well. Really deserves 5 stars! If you get her as a server you‚Äôre in for a good experience."
ChIJTyCaZ7Q0K4gRdLuUpx8kmJk,2,"Of all the branches that I've been to for Captain's boil this has to be the worst. The sauce is same for all of them but this one was not new. The captain's boil sauce was days old and it tasted different. The mussels were not properly dipped in sauce when served. I love captain's boil but would rather visit the North york branch.
PS: service was good and the servers were friendly as well"
ChIJTyCaZ7Q0K4gRdLuUpx8kmJk,5,"Are you familiar with Boiling Crab in California? Well, Captain's Boil is Toronto's own version of it.  Food is perfect for sharing.  First, you order bags of shrimps, mussels, clams, crawfish, crabs, or lobster.  You then choose your sauce (I personally prefer Captain's Boil sauce which is a combination of all their sauces), and you set the spice level.  Allergic to seafood? No worries, they have chicken tenders, chicken wings and breaded fish that you can eat with cajun fries, yam fries, garlic bread, or rice."
ChIJTyCaZ7Q0K4gRdLuUpx8kmJk,2,"If this constitutes your idea of a delivery system for your seafood; enjoy. Me? Not so much. Our server dropped a bag of overly-spiced slop at our table and was never seen again. No follow up and zero cares. The whole model for the restaurant is based on manufacturing incredible amounts of waste in a misguided attempt at a folksy, east coast vibe. At this, it fails miserably. Lose the plastic and tighten up the service."
ChIJB6fiqPo1K4gR6yZP0V9rIlA,5,"We stumbled upon this gem and loved our experience. Food was amazing. Each dish was well balanced and flavorful. The service was very good, attentive and caring.  It‚Äôs a new restaurant, and I highly recommend trying it!"
ChIJB6fiqPo1K4gR6yZP0V9rIlA,5,We really appreciated the generous hospitality from all staff members. We had such a lovely evening in this cozy and elegant space.  From the beautiful oysters at the beginning (best I‚Äôve had In the city) to our last bite of decadent desert - we were in heaven. My partner is still raving about the Wagyu Skirt Steak and the Short Rib! Everything was so delicious! Thank you to a very talented chef - we can‚Äôt wait to visit again soon.
ChIJB6fiqPo1K4gR6yZP0V9rIlA,5,"One of the best meals we have ever had. Everything from the ribs to the octopus to the dessert to the wine, was excellent. The service was top notch and very personable, they made sure we had everything we wanted and that we were happy and satisfied with our meal. Kudos to the manager Gary and our server, Marcella. I highly recommend this restaurant as a place to go to when in Toronto."
ChIJB6fiqPo1K4gR6yZP0V9rIlA,5,Classy restaurant with group oriented items. High quality meats. Intimate atmosphere with approximately 50 seats. A unique dining experience I would recommend.
ChIJB6fiqPo1K4gR6yZP0V9rIlA,5,"Food is unreal!, service is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced, wicked atmosphere! Trendy, busy and definitely a hot spot on weekends. Hands down, my favourite spot to eat along with Copacabana upstairs. The most flavourful steaks I‚Äôve ever had!  The perfect picks - from a tomahawk steaks to wicked fish varieties (oysters and octopus)."
ChIJq7fzx7M0K4gR-rX4EsJ1-gs,5,This is a cozy little place to sit and eat but saw many people order to go. The food was plenty and flavorful. Lots of options. Owner came around to explain the menu and the specials. Waiter was a hit and miss but don't want to ding a star as it felt like he was the only one working. Will give it a try again!
ChIJq7fzx7M0K4gR-rX4EsJ1-gs,4,"The salsas were really good. The rice and chicken could use with some additional seasoning. The pork was good. I had a burrito...not very good for pictures plus I was hungry. Therefore, I didn't take one. The service was good and friendly. If your looking for a quick Mexican restaurant and like salsas, this place is good. Prices were about $15 a plate"
ChIJq7fzx7M0K4gR-rX4EsJ1-gs,5,14 dollar two fish tacos with rice and salad. Food was good. Fish was fresh. They have lunch specials as well. No wireless machine so got to pay at the counter though.
ChIJq7fzx7M0K4gR-rX4EsJ1-gs,5,"I stopped here because I was craving Mexican food on a budget, and I struck gold with this place! The guacamole is so fresh, and the burrito (I got chicken) was bursting with flavor. Combined with the cozy vibe and the tasty hot sauce on your table, this hidden gem is a must-try"
ChIJq7fzx7M0K4gR-rX4EsJ1-gs,5,"This place is awesome! They make a great burrito. Very flavorful. I had the chicken burrito with the hottest sauce. They have milder sauces if that's what you prefer. They also serve sorrel. SORREL!!! It's Jamaican, not Mexican but who cares! It's delicious! They don't add the ginger but I still recommend it. They make it the proper way by boiling the flowers instead of using concentrated juice. Very delicious. I highly recommend this place. Next time you are in the mood for Mexican food, just go for it!"
ChIJUfIZgtw0K4gRSAeYCsChsiU,4,"Another good burger!  This was the second burger place I tried in Toronto.  I ordered the bacon double cheeseburger combo with a chocolate shake.  The chocolate shake was amazing!  The burger itself was good, it smelled good, tasted good but it was not the juiciest burger I have eaten. Would I come back to The Burger's Priest absolutely!"
ChIJUfIZgtw0K4gRSAeYCsChsiU,4,"Burger Priest is one of my favourite places to get burgers! Would recommend the California classic. Took my friend here for the first time last week and she loved it (even said it was better than In-N-Out!) This was also my first time at this location, staff were friendly but sometimes I find their food a bit greasy, but granted it is fast food. Their milkshakes are also good"
ChIJUfIZgtw0K4gRSAeYCsChsiU,4,"Fantastic burgers. Meat quality is a notable cut above others and it comes out in the price. I loved the secret menu concept they had in the beginning. Nice to see that they are keeping it consistent as they scale into a larger chain, hope that doesn't change. Would like to see some specials from these guys."
ChIJUfIZgtw0K4gRSAeYCsChsiU,5,"Went to see what the burger hype was about, left a convert. Had the double cheeseburger with bacon, everything was delicious and fresh. I appreciate cooking on the flat top grill, patties were perfectly cooked and juicy. Would definitely recommend for a burger fix, hope to see one of these places open up closer to me. ü§ò"
ChIJUfIZgtw0K4gRSAeYCsChsiU,2,"Ordered online, said it would be ready at 7:29. When we arrived at 7:22, they said they would call our name when it was ready. They didn't. At 7:35 , after watching 5 other customers get their food before us, we decided to ask how much longer ours would take and they pulled it out from behind the counter. Our burgers were room temperature, and the fries were inedible. 

I'm sure the burgers are great when they're fresh, but I will not be returning to find out."
ChIJPf0LB640K4gRM9WzInQhLkc,3,"The spicy rice cake with deep fried spring roll and dumpling was the bomb. However, the bibimbap we ordered in a stone bowl was literally lacking because they forgot the sauce. Plus, the bowl was not hot enough to crisp up the rice. When asked if we could be charged instead for a regular bowl, they said they can only try to heat up the bowl of our unfinished dish. No thanks, we were too full, and they also forgot to refill our water. Needs better service."
ChIJPf0LB640K4gRM9WzInQhLkc,4,"One of my favorite dishes in the world is the cheese bulgogi and here is the best one I found! Unfortunately the last time I went it was pretty different, I asked what happened and the waitress told me that they change the cheff every here and there. The service is friendly and the restaurant is nice."
ChIJPf0LB640K4gRM9WzInQhLkc,5,"Really enjoyed the Korean style hot pot at this place. It's a spicy soup base with beef, octopus, tofu, mushrooms and glass noodles. The soup was very tasty and perfect for a cold winter day. $35 feeds 2-3 people. Small tables and simple decor at restaurant."
ChIJPf0LB640K4gRM9WzInQhLkc,4,A solid place for lunch. They have lunch specials and you can get pork bone soup and stone bowls. The appetizer  bulgolgi salad is a good size serving. Overall a good place to get Korean fusion food.
ChIJPf0LB640K4gRM9WzInQhLkc,4,"Great food at decent prices. The hot pot is tasty without being overbearing, and the portion sizes are large enough for a group of people to share. There's an extensive mix of menu items and ingredients, and service is great during busy periods as well. Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for some Korean cuisine!"
ChIJt-miAdI0K4gR41iJsE1PyYE,4,"A bit overpriced for what you get. It is a beautiful restaurant in an upscale hotel. Food was average, service was excellent. Overall, not the best option for the price you pay. I have yet to try their outdoor patio which should be nice in the summer. I tried the brunch which wasn't great. Dinner was better. Expect to pay high prices. A good option if you are staying in the hotel."
ChIJt-miAdI0K4gR41iJsE1PyYE,5,"I went there after dinner to have tea and dessert. The dessert was okay and the tea was really good. It was a coincidence that Jim Treliving from ""Dragons' Den"" was sitting at the table right across us. Though we didn't disturb him. Ambience of the place is upscale and vibe is fantastic. Little overpriced but justified. The dining area is huge and spacious. Chairs are comfortable. Took a long time in getting the cheque and finally paying it."
ChIJt-miAdI0K4gR41iJsE1PyYE,5,This is one of the most decent restaurants in Toronto. Have been here for a few times in winter and summerlicious. They change their menu every year so better do research before you order. Suggest to do wine pairing as it won‚Äôt be too much additional costs but you can have three different glasses of wine paired for three courses.
ChIJt-miAdI0K4gR41iJsE1PyYE,5,Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Delicious food. They got the fusion taste down right.
ChIJt-miAdI0K4gR41iJsE1PyYE,5,"OMG, the best, most savoury dishes and the staff verify if you have any food limitations"
